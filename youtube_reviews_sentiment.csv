This movie gives me bad anxiety,0
" @supernathanjr  Nathan my man, the movie showed nothing about what kind of man Oppenheimer was. The movie focused how the US government trying to write Oppenheimer off as a communist and he redeemed himself by making a weapon of mass destruction. The movie was a mess and only showed Oppenheimer was cheating on his wife and did a very bad job at it.",0
"No hyperbole here -- I saw this at home after being floored in the theater and it was even better the second time. It's that rarest of things -- a stone-cold action masterpiece on par with the greats -- a top-tier classic that belongs beside THE KILLER, THE RAID, and DIE HARD. Easily the most formidable action epic since FURY ROAD. A++ 10/10 Five stars!",0

"I was wondering how the theme of time, that all of Nolan's movies have in common will play into this film. I see that the film is going to explore the atomic bomb as a sort of time bomb that may well destroy our world at some point in the future. If you think about it the existence of the atomic bomb may well function the same way a black hole's singularity does as in it being not a point in space but a point in time in which all our existence on earth is heading towards its inevitable destruction.",0
"My one of the favourite lines from the movie was...joker saying to himself,,,""I used to think that my life is a TRAGEDY but now i realise that it is nothing but COMEDY""....so, u can imagine how disturbing a movie could be with it's theme being 'TRAGEDY=COMEDY'...but it was not that disturbing for me as i am used to of or aware of the ongoing social-political structure of our country !!!",0

"_Now is the story all about how,
My life got fuck-up ruined and wasted,
And I'd like to take a minute, just shit right there,
I'll tell you how I became the Kaiser of a town called Valor._

_In Autism Texas, born and raised
Riding horse cock is where I spent most of my days.
Drinkin' up, maxin', relaxin all cool,
And always fuckin Mary-jane outside of the school._

_When a couple of guys who were up to no good,
Started makin' trouble by shootin' up my neighborhood.
I got one little felony, and my mom got scared,
And said ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Valor.""_

_I whistled for a cabbie, and when it came near,
The license plate said ""Pussy"" and it had a didlo on the mirror.
If anything I could say that this cab was rape,
But I thought ""Nah forget it, Yo home to Valor.""_

_I pulled up to the palace about nine or ten,
and I yelled to the cabby ""Yo Bro, suck ya later.""
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there,
To sit on my throne as the Kaiser of Valor_",0
"guys, listen to me. While you're milking this already,  please add some tech to it and connect it to cyberpunk77 somehow. I know it's a challange but I believe you can do it.

"""The King of Comedy"" is not a tale of one man’s humiliation, but a bigger story about the nihilistic dead ends of fans’ celebrity worship and the culture that cultivates it. 

""Taxi Driver"" is not the story of a hero, but of a madman who fancies himself a hero. And both hang the people who idolize them out to dry.

""Joker"" is by mashing the two together in one tale — and removing most of their films’ humor and irony — a movie wrapping the Bickle/Pupkin avatar into the skin of the Joker, an icon of chaos who’s become a meme for the internet’s angry-man elements on the fringe and yielded a healthy dose of rancid anger. It’s hard to really do with Fleck what The King of Comedy did with Pupkin when the Joker’s biggest fans veer awfully close to a Pupkin type with Bickle-like aspirations.

Sadly for Fleck and his eventual Joker evolution, the resulting character is just a pathetic victim, and we know what we’re supposed to feel for him: pity. That’s signaled throughout the movie, loud and clear. He is beaten up, abandoned, mocked, and mistaken.

Unlike Bickle and Pupkin, when Fleck finally finds himself through violence, it reads unequivocally as a moment of self-actualization. He did it, guys. He finally overcame his oppressors and came into his own. Sure, you can condemn his actions. But then, aren’t you the bad guy?


This article put words on how I felt about Joker. Why it doesn't work for me. It feels more like an imitation of two supperior movies. 
Joaquin Phoenix still one of the greatest actors tho. Commudus - one of the best villains oof all time. And also his depiction of Freddie Quell",0

"The greatest war crime in human history is glorified here. No wonder the film isn't being shown in Japan. That brings tears to your eyes.

I've been to the Hiroshima museum and also Nagasaki (Hiroshima has the better one). Everyone should see this. Civilians died in the most cruel ways. women, children. This is the worst way to die, from radioactivity. The body is already dead, but the person is still walking. Maggots in the body, internal bleeding, vomiting, slow organ failure, etc. Then disabled children were born after the war, or children died of leukemia. Americans sent their doctors who constantly examined everything like a human experiment. Yes, that went down in history. I repeat: This was truly the greatest war crime in human history.",0

These movies get more and more Rediculous. This was terrible. It's totally like a comic book story. A car that can't be lifted by helicopters but swings around and destroys the helos! Wahaha. The brother that kills himself for a big explosion that is meaningless as it doesnt take out the bad guy. Mr Nobodys daughter has clear view to kill the bad guy but doesnt shoot him. A prison in Antartica? The cost to fly there isn't worth the prison. A sub that meets the woman.  Driving down the spillway of a damn. The son that jumps from the car. So many stupid explosions and unrealistic events. Its just dumb. I have come up with a rediculous sequel as it made me laugh at the stupidity of this movie. Boooo!!,0
So Nuclear war didn't wipe humanity from the face of the earth it was Christopher Nolan making a movie about nuclear power 💨,0

I think this might make a bunch of people think Penny Fleck is the main antagonist for driving the plot and being the reason why Arthur Fleck became the villainous Joker he is today. She’s more one of the two main antagonists (alongside Thomas Wayne) mainly because her overall abuse with Arthur truly created a movie and in the other hand Thomas Wayne antagonize Arthur Fleck and was much more of a obstacle to him.,0
"Bruh you do realize this story is set 10,000 years into the future? The races in the Dune universe are  a product of thousands of years of mixing and nothing like the ones that exist today.

It's like you all are obligated to be hostile against everything for some reason.",0

"The Lord wants sinners to come to Him in repentance, that's why God the Father came as Jesus Christ in the flesh to save and reconcile us back to Him ( Romans 5)! He came to save us from sin's damnation and cure us from it's curse and set us free from it's bondage and give us life, healing, freedom and forgiveness and redemption and salvation by Him and His Holy Spirit ( Luke 4:18-19)! Jesus went as the lamb of God and made Himself as a sacrificial offering for our sins, He went and took all of our sins and God's wrath on the cross, He took God's Holy hatred that was for us because of our sins and He took that for us on the cross even though He was and is innocent and we was and are guilty! Jesus never sinned, He kept all of God's Holy law and never broke one ( Matthew 5:17, 1 Peter 2:22) but we didn't do like Christ, we human beings disobeyed God and ate the forbidden fruit, we brought sin into the world because of our disobedience towards God our Holy Heavenly Creator and Father! but Jesus took all of our guilt, shame, sin to the cross and suffered God's wrath, our punishment, our sins for us on that cross and all the pain, insults, and beatings He went through could not dare compare to God's wrath He went through and yet what's astounding about this is that He didn't have to do it He didn't have to take you and my sin to the cross He didn't have to suffer our punishment for us, He could have called a legion of Holy angels and have us destroyed, He could have went back to Heaven and we all perished in our sins But BUT Because of His love and mercy He has for us He went through it all on the cross and died and paid for our sin debt and penalty in full, He  the rose again on the third day with glory and power and triumph and conquered hell, sin, death, satan, and the world and broke down the wall that separated us from the Him. we are unworthy of all that Jesus did for us but He did it for us anyway! that is true love and that same true love is calling all sinners to repentance. Jesus is the only way to Heaven and Salvation and He has His hand out offering salvation and forgiveness of sin and redemption to everyone, Let's pray they'll answer His call and come to Him and turn from their sin and turn to Him for salvation, forgiveness of sin and redemption that He offers to everyone everyday and that the same people will surrender their all to Him and become born again by the Holy Spirit ( John 3:3-8, John 14:6) Amen",0

"Dreaming about Mr. Amitabh Bachchan! 😍🫣

In the dream, his image is the same as ""Brahmastra: Part One Shiva""!

In the dream, there is a pair of sisters and brothers. Their father is an evil magician. For his own purpose, he even used the weakness of the sister and brother's brother to accomplish it!

In order to save her younger brother who has been controlled by her father's magic, the older sister fights against the evil magician together with Mr. Amitabh Bachchan!

Just when the battle was intense to the critical moment (the battle was super exciting), I saw Mr. Amitabh Bachchan suddenly shouted ""(the name of this character; the name of the sister's brother)""!!!!!

In my dream, I saw a building that seemed to be similar to the Pont du Gard as the background location of the battle!",0

"This Is My Parody 

The Fresh Killer Of Littleton (Dylan Klebold)

Now, this is a story all about how 
My Life got flipped-turned upside down
And I’d like to take a minute 
Just sit right there 
I’ll tell you how i became the fresh killer of a town called Littleton 

(Chorus)

In Littleton,Colorado Born and Raised
In Columbine High School Where I spent most my days
Chillin’ out, maxin’, relaxin’, All Cool
and Chillin with my friend Eric During School
When a couple of jocks who were up to no good
Started Making Trouble in the Neighborhood 
I got into a Altercation and Brooks Reacted 
Eric Said: “Don’t Worry This Happens all the time in Columbine High School”

I begged and pleaded with them day after day 
But they Picked on me and gave me a Slap
They Gave a Push and then they gave me my ticket 
I put on my coat on and said, “Might as well kick it”

First Class, yo this is bad
Tripping over something and Falling on Glass
Is this what the people of Littleton Living like?
Hmm, this might be alright 

But Wait, I hear its Toxic, Elitist, All That
Is this the type of place that they just send their child?
I don’t Think so
I’ll see when i get there 
I hope they’re prepared for The Fresh Killer Of Littleton.

I whistled For a cab and when it came near
The License plate said, “Fresh” and it had dice in the mirror 
If anything I could say that this cab was rare 
But I thought “Nah Forget it, Yo holmes to Littleton”.

(Chorus)

I pulled up to the school about 11:00
And yelled to eric “Yo Eric, Ready for this?”
I looked at my prison
I was Finally there 
To sit on my Throne as The Fresh Killer Of Littleton.",0
"It's funny how this series made it to F10 but not a single line of ""Fast and Furious""",0
"Visually good but the only problem with this film is, it being a dialogue-driven film, music had to be just rightly mixed. Instead, they mixed it  too high that in the final act, it muffles key dialogues, to the point where you have to depend on subtitles. And I watched it even with headphones; no help. I don't know if this is a faulty disc mastering issue or a so-called pretentious artsy-fartsy choice, but overall ruined the film for me. Visually very good but it is a film, not a painting; has to balance every element. Tenet also had the same trouble but it was still ok and never this bad. And the reading of that holy book post-coitus was so weird and felt out of place; and her character was one of the most spectacularly annoying ones ever on silver-screen (even worse than Mona from FRIENDS)!",0

"Overrated movie, don't understand the high score on IMDB. Not only was the editing horribly done and confusing, the message of the movie was highly politically biased and is basically propaganda. The movie was way too long and could have been 2 hours. And ofcourse it wouldn't be a Hollywood film if there were no misplaced sex scenes involved. The dropping of the bomb on Japan on none civilian targets was basically genocide and a war crime, but the movie didn't touch upon this subject. Also the movie fail to mention that Admiral Chester Nimitz who was in command of the pacific fleet campaign against Japan, wrote a petition to Harry S Truman personally not to use the bomb as the Japanese were about to surrender anyways. However Japan wanted to surrender to Russia under conditions. USA wanted Japan to surrender to USA unconditionally. The dropping of the bomb was therefore politically motivated and was not necessary. This is a failed opportunity of Nolan to clarify history and make this topic relevant that USA should never have built this bomb and use it and basically committed war crimes while doing so, but instead make it anti communist movie instead. The communist threat that never existed. Vietnam became a moderate country, and China is more capitalist than any western nations. The Soviet Russians became democratic and that worked out of them alot, NOT. Russia under a democracy became more military aggressive than during the Soviets communist era. Since democracies have conducted more wars the past few decades than communism, this checks out.",0

i like Keanu, Donnie Yen and that long hair Japanese man who killed by Wolverine and Hawkeye Ronin (his character often dead before movie ends)

any movie after 3 is usually Lame and Ridiculous just making shits up out due to running out of idea.

Whats next? a fingerless old nun shooting a submachine gun from inside of an igloo? an old monk with stroke swimming across pasific ocean to hunt Jwick? or Jwick riding an armored donkey to a mosque in north pole to kill a high table bosses with boomerang?

"The movie is one-time watchable (except for the annoying laser and pyaar stuff). Also wondering why, a story based on Hindu mythology/theology is filled with ugly Urdu words (rabba, husn, mohabbat, ishq, fiqr, raftaar, junoon, dafan, fitoor, aashiq...etc.). They should have used pure Hindi language.",0
"A little disappointing, to be honest. The movie lacked the kind of dialogue that was in Wick 1-3, and the direction (to end the high table) it alluded to in Wick 3. I was expecting Laurence Fishburne to play a bigger role. The villain's role was not excitable. There were too many locations to consider. Nevertheless, Keanu Reeves and the guest actors killed their roles. Bravo to all the actors! RIP Lance Reddick 🕊",0

Paul was a Writer / Journalist, Taking notes of rising populated groups such as Antifa, And The Republican Guild, He used to go into Instagram / Facebook HQ / Offices to ask questions about Instagram and why they hide the ""Truth"" This continued until one day, someone gave him note of a Republican Guild Meetup, So Paul went, Without knowing the consequences, Antifa Jumped him on his way out of The Meetup, He dropped his bag and started to fight with them, In the end no one won, because Officers Arrived on the scene and broke the fight up, So Paul went home and had a hard think about what just happened, but it didnt stop there, Antifa would track Paul's family home down, and threaten his Mother to burn the house down, And other death threats etc, So thats when he got to his breaking point, and took to the internet, His first stream he quotes ""If this is the only way to spread the message, then so be it.""

My life got fucking turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the mothrerfucking prince of a town called Bel-A

In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground is where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of niggers who were up to no good
Started makin' trouble in my motherfucking neighbourhood
I got in one little fight shit and my mom got scared
And said ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said ""I might as well kick this shit""
First class, yo, this is bad motherfucker
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be all right
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, and all that

Some scenes were less than 20 seconds if that.

Everyone saying Arthur’s mother wasn’t his real mother is kinda missing the point of his shock and feelings of betrayal. He was upset upon realizing the extent of his childhood abuse and how poorly she cared for him. Him being adopted wasn’t necessarily the issue. A mother who has adopted a child isn’t any less legitimate than a mother who gives birth. And there’s also an aspect of being unable to tell whether the document is fabricated or not. Because it seems weird that they would allow a person like her to adopt a child when she has a history of mental disorders and poor finances.,0

Using IMAX was a waste.   I couldn't tell if we were present day or a flash back.  Nolan's non linear structure obsession is extremely confusing when there are so many characters.  Who is this guy??  are we present day??  After a while i didn't care.  Cillian Murphy's portrayal was gimmicky.  Nolan decision to do the Atomic Bomb with a truck full of gasoline was insanely dumb.  As soon as the bomb went off I just rolled my eyes.  it looked nothing like an atomic detonation.  And then there was another hour of dry conversations at a desk.   It was a yawn fest.  I expected so much more.  IMAX doesn't work if the material is flat and non cinematic.   @MATDMixes ",0

"​ @jean-claudelol563  You're either a fan of the David Lynch's Dune or a fan of Frank Herbert's Dune (which means being the fan of books and the new movies). The 1984 movie was hardly Dune. The tone was off, the literal point of the story was glossed over (the fact that Dune is supposed to be a cautionary tale), the acting was horrendous, the writing was awful and the ending was stupid (Paul became some weird godlike entity who could make it rain but still didn't knew that water kills sandworms). Not only Frank Herbert hated that travesty but Lynch himself did too.

Paul Atreides is supposed to be a ""15 year old boy"" who looks rather small for his age (novel Paul is even more of a twink than Chalamet) and this was written on the very FIRST page of the FIRST book. He sways the Fremen by exploiting the established superstitions using his prescience and by proving himself on the field, not by flashing his biceps. Your criticisms of the movie aren't even criticisms, they're nitpicks constructed around the appearance of the character and those nitpicks aren't valid nitpicks either considering they're stemming from your ignorance of the lore.",0
" @maazahmed506  I could not disagree more with your review on both the 1984 and the remake. Your opinion is backwards. The books were awesome though the first book was the best one of the series. The only thing I would criticize about the 1984 film is that it had to leave so much out. The movie is long but the book would take a tv series season or two to do it justice. As for this remake, I barely recognize the original Dune story from the book. Even having 2 very long movies with which to tell the story they managed to leave even more out of the film than the standalone 1984 version. Maybe in another 20 or 30 years they’ll do another remake and someone may finally improve upon the 1984 film. The remake left so much out and did not manage to include anything at all that might have been left out of the 1984 film. They even failed to include the Harkonnen Barron’s fetish with boys that was quite well and tastefully included in 1984 and all but ignored in the remake. In an era where everything woke goes they failed miserably to capture a very important part of one of the main characters. In fact they practically left the Harkonnens out of the story much beyond the invasion, they were delegated to minor unimportant characters as were the tutors of Paul Atreides, Duncan Idaho, Dr Yueh, Thugir Hawat, all became minor almost irrelevant characters, I must have blinked because I don’t even recall the Shadout Mapes, the Duke and Lady Jessica barely mattered in the story nor did the Bebe Gesserit Reverend Mother or their order. The only character they bothered to try and develop was Paul Atreides and it was pathetic. The Baron’s nephews were barely mentioned. It was sad all around and a flop as far as I am concerned. Writing this response has made me realize this remake was so much worse than I had originally thought, I gave it too much credit.",0

"As soon as someone uses the term ""woke"" you already know that their opinion is worthless. Because wtf do you mean weak story and weak acting? Keanu Reeves was never a good actor, he made a career on  likeability and looks. The reason he is so loved in John Wick is his stunt work which he takes incredibly seriously despite approaching 60. And the stories of these films always been weak. The first revolves around a dead dog and the others (especially the 3rd) is just a manhunt. Tell me that Reeves has slowed down because of age, that the presence of so many martial artists reduces John's badass factor, that the film and the fight scenes are too long or that you feel the Marvelification of the franchise  and I could have taken you seriously.

"This piece of music highlights one critique I do have with at least, some Japanese music. It sometimes ends up sounding like nothing more then a bunch of sour or dark notes.

That will never come up again. So the song then just kind of, drags on. Going through rhythm after rhythm, that while they may sound similar. Are never truly repeated. And that’s not a great thing when sometimes only one instrument is being used.",0

Well, that's how I felt watching this. Are you freaking kidding me? The guys he fights are these oddly shaped gargantuan guys wearing giant gogo boots so we don't notice how slow he's gotten. When he's fighting more than one guy the one he's not facing is doing weird sh*t to waste time until he turns around. It's ridiculous. Any slower & he'd be in reverse. It's like they got everyone from the first 3 to make a straight-to-video version, and then managed to get it into theaters. I just started watching it today, & I can't even finish it. My favorite movies are B-grade, cheesey 80's, independent and foreign & this movie is friggin dumb. The guys in here, I think, are from the same casting company they used to use in older Jackie Chan movies. Same place they found the ""Russian"" in ""The Punisher."" Really big, really dumb, and really slow. It's actually sad watching this.

The director destroyed the brand and should never be supported with this genre again.

I like my lead heroes to be big and strong and not small, meek-looking, and barely 100 pounds like Timothee Chalamet. This director should not be asked to do epic films anymore. They are too big for him, in my opinion. Zach Snyder (DC Comics) or the Russo Brothers (Marvel) might have had more exciting takes on the Dune saga. Denis Villeneuve's version was a waste of time and money, in my opinion -- the movie studio's money, and the money I spent at the box office and concession stand. I nearly fell asleep in the theater. Overall, this was a wasted opportunity! Finally, I am sick of people who say they love something when they know deep down it was really bad.

"I really like these movies. But it almost seems like the underworld is hell. Some of the stuff they say is pretty freaky.  I will serve you, is one. Stuff I wouldn't have part of. It's almost like they sold their soul to the devil, the underworld. Scary stuff.",0

"The first movie was okay. But each following movie sucked more and more. It got to the point where it felt like the whole plot of the movies was just killing as many people as possible, for no real reason. By the time I watched part 4, I couldn't even remember the first three, or what the whole story was. Everybody was just killing everyone constantly. It got SO repetitive. These are the type of movies that I don't care about EVER watching a second time. I could barely get through them once. It was SO dragged out.",0
The worst Fast and furious out of the entire series . Just watched the movie and was disappointed,0
Anyone thought why Isha is attached to Shiva from the first Coz she is Asur (Villain) taking advantage of Shivas Love.. Remember the last scene where the kid is killed there is no junoon at that time 😯😂 ..but we all think junoon climbed and killed the kid ..no bro it's Isha,0

Impending Judgment on the Earth
24 Behold, the Lord makes the earth empty and makes it waste,
Distorts its surface
And scatters abroad its inhabitants.
2 And it shall be:
As with the people, so with the priest;
As with the servant, so with his master;
As with the maid, so with her mistress;
As with the buyer, so with the seller;
As with the lender, so with the borrower;
As with the creditor, so with the debtor.
3 The land shall be entirely emptied and utterly plundered,
For the Lord has spoken this word.

4 The earth mourns and fades away,
The world languishes and fades away;
The haughty people of the earth languish.
5 The earth is also defiled under its inhabitants,
Because they have transgressed the laws,
Changed the ordinance,
Broken the everlasting covenant.
6 Therefore the curse has devoured the earth,
And those who dwell in it are desolate.
Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned,
And few men are left.

7 The new wine fails, the vine languishes,
All the merry-hearted sigh.
8 The mirth of the tambourine ceases,
The noise of the jubilant ends,
The joy of the harp ceases.",0

"The first episode of John Wick was more or less acceptable, the second one boring, the third one bad. The fourth part is extremely bad, even ridiculous. Why? Well, I watched the full three hours and saw an endless sequence of villains being murdered, preferably by being shot in their head. John is indestructible; he fell from a 4 floor building, a 222 step stairs, was being run over several times by cars and bikes but our man keeps on running and fighting. He even survives an attack by an huge army of heavily armed criminals. Fortunately John is wearing a bulletproof costume so he can hide his head in his jacket whenever needed.

1 Ranbir was lost. he didn't know how to portray sadly or love scenes
2 More than half of the movie showed romance which was obviously disgusting  
3 the story is not worth even a single penny
4 using south Indian actors if they think they can make a hit they are wrong
5 Alias acting was worth the word cringe

I don't hate Bollywood but these points will stop you from watching this movie it is really bad don't waste your hard-earned money on this absolutely undeserving movie

for more info
the ticket costs 2050 yes you read it right

"Like wonder woman 1984 it is missing the atmosphere of the era being portrayed.
The story of Gotham as a city was neglected, They should have expanded on the gutter politics of Thomas Wayne as a Bloomsberg style fat cat that fomented an antebellum of neolibral thatcherite and draconian conservative reganomics that invoked a mass uprising of civil unrest that declared war between the haves and the have nots which saw the protagonist rise to fame as a martyr to a long awaited cause.

Elements of: Taxi Driver, Death Wish, Cape Fear, and The King of Comedy can all be felt in this watered downed portrayal of the Joker.

"Like Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks in THE PRODUCERS, they made a movie so bad, they would get rich off the insurance claims.  Is that what Limey Christopher Nola is shoot for?  I walked out on Oppenheimer at 2hrs 20 mins.  The problem with this movie is that, to use academic terminology, it sucks. Dialogue is an essential component of film, and audiences are trained to pay attention to it above all else. We may feel the score and hear the sound of explosions or gunfire, but we actively listen for language. Drowning out the dialogue gives us the sense we're missing something important, making it impossible to focus on anything else.  Apparently Nolan, thinks are too stupid to understand dialogue.",0
This movie is perfect Lame example of HOW selfish narratives are set in name of one’s religion.. Shame on the makers to use a religion to hype the fake narratives of destruction… showing their cursed mentality 😂,0

", ""Oppenheimer"",  it's clear that it's another glorification of the architects of destruction. It's a tale spun by the industrial ruling class, a narrative that paints the creators of the most devastating weapon in human history as heroes. But let's not forget, these are the same minds that have brought us to the brink of self-destruction, the same minds that have poisoned the Navajo Nation with their unending radioactive spill.

The industrial ruling class and their nuclear energy tell us a story of progress and power, but what they don't tell us is the cost.

You look on any of those trailers and you see everybody's just as lost as the people who have created this system. They just speak of the movie itself but not that it has a stark impact on our lives as human beings"". But they had become so assimilated they no longer can tell the difference

 @N12534-f  that’s honestly the stupidest thing I’ve heard.. the movie itself was just bad… yeah sure nobody wanted Arthur.. but everything the 2nd film did just completely made the 1st film pointless.. he became this character larger than himself by the end of the 1st film and now he just doesn’t exist. I doubt that you’re right cause I doubt the Warner Bros would be willing to push Arthur’s point to flop a movie cause according to your theory they knew it would flop.,0
Yes.. it ruins the 1st movie… literally the entire buildup of the 1st movie is destroyed cause we don’t see the Joker at all in the 2nd film. All we get is Arthur fleck.. and the musical scenes are just.. so unnecessary and happen so often and randomly. There’s no actual storyline happening and by the end it feels like nothing was achieved expect the Jokers character being backtracked back into Arthur Fleck…,0
I got in one little fight and Chris's mom got mad,0
"​ @dosomestuff1949  I wouldn't call it excuses since it was a necessity. The atomic bomb brought peace between nuclear powers, without it there would have been WW 3 already. So, nuclear weapons are actually a good thing, although most people fail not realize it. The physicists including Oppenheimer were no fools, they knew exactly that mutually assured destruction brings peace (assuming rational agents) and someone else would build it anyway.
Von Neumann was a different breed than Oppenheimer: He suggested to bomb the Soviets before they gained access to nuclear weapons: ""With the Russians it is not a question of whether but of when. If you say why not bomb them tomorrow, I say why not today?"" (By the way, von Neumann was left out of the movie, although he played an important role in the Manhattan project and thereafter.)",0
Sad how Joker 2 was so bad it reached back in time and ruined this movie.,0
Knowing how the minds of Babylonian white boys (the principle ones ruling over us) work – and how they pulled a fast one on the world by releasing the movie Contagion in 2011 as a prelude to what they planned on doing in the future (in 2019) by releasing the Covid-19 virus – one must realize that this new movie Oppenheimer has very likely been made for the same reason – meaning – as an indication of their future plans to drop another virus bomb upon the planet. The fact is that these boys aren’t really that interested in making movies based on past history. And although they’ll used events that took place in the past to make a movie – but that’s just to use such serve as a cover for what they plan on doing or are actually presently already doing. The fact is – that about 8 years before they dropped the covid-19 virus bomb on the planet – they made a movie not only about what they planned to do – but in the movie they even gave the area of the world regarding where they’d drop the virus bomb – meaning in China (see movie trailer - Contagion). However their first attempt (by way of the Covid-19 bomb) to eradicate most of us off the planet didn’t happen as they’d hoped – but one thing I know about Babylonian white boys – they have not changed their minds or their plans to kill us all off – and so the Covid-19 or some similar type of virus will be used by them again against us – just wait and see.,0

I have zero interest in trying to understand this war criminal and much less the trivialities of his private life as the consecuences of his actions are glossed over.,0
"Here's my opinion on each season

Season 1: I kinda like this season even if it was forgettable. 7/10

Season 2: This was the only season where I was laughing on a consistent basis, aside from Stripe Tease For Two, this season was pretty much flawless. 7.5/10

Season 3: There are some episodes I like but that doesn't take anyway from the fact that Season 3 was a miserable season as this season has a negative tone. 3/10

Season 4: IMO this is the worst season of this show, aside from Blood Is Thicker Than Mud, no episode stand out and of course that overrated episode (the you know what) that I consider the worst episode of this show. 2/10

Season 5: Season 5 of any show is known for being forgettable and having too many attempts at poor comedy and this show is no except other than Bullets Over Bel-Air which I consider the best episode of this show, this whole season was a chore to get through. 4.5/10

Season 6: Aside from I, Done & Not With My Cousin You Don't, this whole season was even more of a chore to get through & it was one of the few times where I was annoyed throughout the entire season, seriously Uncle Phil is being beyond frustrating in this season. 2.5/10",0
"Htiler and Oppenheimer are two sides of the same coin. One was on the losing side and his name is daily cursed, the other was on the side of the victors and still we have to endure turgid and cynical attempts to whitewash this criminal like this crap movie. He didn't end anything, the war was altready over, but neither USA  nor the USSR wanted  Japan to surrender before the first had used the atomic bombs on civilians and the Soviets hadn't taken Manchuria.

"I argue that in ancient China and Korea such tone of music  existed and were  thought out to play by some music artists, 

but it was not accepted because it's not glorious or happy for their kingdoms to play in history.


It's still often common to hear 
Chinese and Koreans disliking such music as low, pathetic or not-done or uncanny. It was always been like that in China and Korea that putting your head up and boasting yourself along with others is expected to make harmony. 

Being humble as a lifestyle was  unpopular, and unaccepted except for authority. 

Nowadays its dislike is even more intense as it refers to Japanese music as ugly  because they ""deserve it"". All Just because of their own often hateful anti-Japanese overly nationalist grudges of WWII. 

Because in Japan such music was more accepted by the ancient authorities in history, in fact is a sign of low style humbleness and expressing ones sadness or gloomy feelings for society is more accepted than in fact  boasting ones self like others.
Sometimes Japanese play the happy ones, in most daily life usually in a peaceful way.

Humbleness of self depreciation is not just about obedience in Japan, but it's a valued quality of character.",0

One is before interval special appearance character were shown. After interval there was no special appearance, which director would have done easily. Atleast shud have shown glmpse of Shiva's parents. Second & important one was Big b role. Very small with no fight scenes. 1-2 fight scenes were there. Since he was shown as Guru he shud have got more fight scenes. Small child & one girl was seen fighting but big b was getting beaten by mouni's goon. Big b shud not work in part 2 & 3 if there are no fight scenes for him. All fights were done in vfx then why big b was not given fight scenes? How stupid of ayan",0

And William sure is lucky that the cabbie just happened to drop him off right in front of his auntie and uncle's Bel-Air McMansion, considering the fact that the only direction that Billiam gave the driver was ""Yo, homes, to Bel-Air!"" with no address or region of Bel-Air to go to, no nothing!

I was the only guy in the cinema hall who cheered when Arthur danced after killing those three guys, who felt bad when arthur was in pain and who felt relieved and clapped in the last scenes when Arthur was standing on the top of the car, accepting his destiny. That day i came home and my wife saw a very different side of me, because she couldnt understand why i was so connected to the movie...i cried and cried and cried that day because all that was in my past came back crashing in my mind...i was bullied all childhood and teenage. I never knew why being innocent and not hurting anyone was taken as symbol of weakness... this movie took out my vulnerabilities and washed them away which i had controlled over the years.

" @Eleyrica  First of all, I felt the story was told in a way that was difficult to follow, going back and forth in time. Would have been better if the story was told chronologically. Second, they did a poor job introducing the characters. Third, I didn't like that they portrayed him as a mad genius. He was indeed intelligent but he wasn't mad. What about the poisoning of his teacher's apple with potassium cyanide?! He never did that! Fourth, they added too much fake drama that was not believable at all. The acting was all also very fake. Hard to describe, but easily identifiable as something made in Hollywood. In my theater, about 20% of the people left, many others were bored out of their mind. Just a poorly thought-out film overall. Fifth, it also failed to really put things in context regarding the situation at the time. The gravity of nazi Germany exterminating the Jews in Europe as well as developing their own nuclear weapons and delivery systems. Also attacking the US with their submarines. How this impacted the urgency to the scientists, most of whom were Jews themselves and who knew about the horrors of what was going on to their families in Europe.They also hardly showed the situation in the Pacific with the Japanese. All this wasn't really emphasized.  I just felt the film was very superficial and poorly thought out. They just really dumbed things down, and in doing so they lost the whole context of the world situation at the time. But dumbing things down is what Hollywood does best. This subject was too heavy and complex for Hollywood to handle and the producers of this movie proved it.",0

"I thought the movie sucked. He made it from the wrong book. He should have adapted
from The Making of the Atomic Bomb by Richard Rhodes—a terrific book. But this movie was 80% turned over to Oppenheimer and Robert Strauss being grilled by  various committees on the subject of Oppenheimers  commie sympathies. All this jabbering—on and on and on. Who cares?  I was in a coma.  I am there  to see a movie about The Bomb and how it was made—with all the details right from the beginning when the atom was split by Ernest Rutherford.  Instead I got Robert Strauss. Who he—a figure lost to history.

The music. The movie sucked and the music compounded the effect. Its overwhelming and relentless—on and on and on —like all that jabbering.  I kept waiting for a scene with Oppenheimer in the toilet taking a leak with the violins sawing away.

"Great movie but nuclear power was invented earlier. Long time ago there was another planet in our solar system between Mars and Jupiter on which (giant) humans lived. They too invented nuclear power, but in a war they misused that nuclear power and the planet was destroyed. Only the four moons of that planet survived the destruction. The asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter is the visible remaining part of that destruction. The name of that planet was Mallona, Mallona means 'broken planet'. To the old Greeks Mallona was known as Phaeton. In the books of Jakob Lorber and Leopold Engel you can find more information about that.",0

"OK. Writing this the day after having seen the movie in IMAX. GO 👏🏽SEE 👏🏽 THIS 👏🏽 MOVIE. Any politician, any military general, any human being I think should understand this story, the consequences of with which we still live with today and which perhaps with renewed fear since the end of the Cold War in the late eighties with the recent geopolitical realities as of late. What can I say. It is 3 hours of sometimes clunky dialogue, sometimes difficult to hear conversations, but also of awe-inspiring, moving, horrifying images, of nightmarish dread and angst and guilt, of suggestions of death on such a massive scale that it dwarfs the mind. Do not watch the movie if you are already feeling down, I think: I left the theater a shell of myself, haunted and seared, burned in a way, by what I had just seen. It is such cinematic power and strength, such visual poetry, and such a nightmare that will leave marks on you. The scene where Oppenheimer announced to his fellow Manhattan Project members that they successfully deployed the bomb over Hiroshima. The scene where they are casually choosing which cities to bomb. The entire ending sequence. Pure horror, pure visceral body-gut-reaction -sick-to-my-stomach dread and despair. It was such a PHYSICAL movie. It succeeded in so many ways of not just telling us things, but really making us SEE them, FEEL them, EXPERIENCE them. Not a perfect movie, has some flaws, but overall a masterstroke of anti-war, existential nightmare filmmaking. Wow. Bravo, Nolan.",0
"The movie was going very well. Until towards the end he started talking nonsense. Especially when lovers, partners and wives came together, formed a union of some kind and attacked.

So when later the Batman comes around the Joker needs not to ""organize"" any help around him... he just again rides a new wave of disconetnt. When confronted by Batman the Joker instesd knows that his parents were not killee by a mugger, but by ""some pissed off guy"". Bruce Wayne goes on to repress that memory and believed he or his alter-ego Batman was born out of necessity to fight crime, and when confronting the Joker he looks at him as a criminal and never fully understands what the Joker understood: that just like the Joker they are both children of misfortune and anarchy.

"It’s been out for a while now but I finally got to see this yesterday. Don’t get me wrong I loved it, its one of the most spectacular action movies I’ve ever seen and I didn’t feel awkward with the high body count as everyone is a hitman/woman or working with them and John fights in self defence. 

However its sooo far fetched and ridiculous how much he survives and can carry on fighting and some of the main characters. Noone in this is a cyborg, alien or superhero or supervillain. He gets knocked off the bonnet of more than one car and is fine, gets kicked down several feet onto a concrete floor and is okay, falls through a glass window on the third floor of a townhouse onto a car roof and gets up ok! An assassins dog gets hit by a car and bumps off the bonnet and gets up and runs off! 

A big fight develops in a Berlin night club dance floor and its ages before anyone acknowledges it and they evacuate. John goes into a Russian Orthodox Church and gets blasted with a shotgun by obviously a fake priest and John is fine! When things kicks off in Berlin and Paris including amongst the traffic you don’t see any police at all. There’s a guy whose a hitman whose lost his sight but manages to fight perfectly and shoot a gun in exactly the right direction just going on hearing. It’s crazy but if you liked the other films or stuff like this you have to see it. 5/5",0

"It was Jardine Matheson & Co. of international financial capital Rothschild, not Britain, that launched the opium war against China.At the end of the Edo period in Japan, Commodore Matthew Perry, who came to Japan to open the country, was related to the Rothschild family.Japan's Meiji Restoration was a farce between the British and French Rothschilds for financial control.They set up a civil war and lent weapons and funds to both sides, and made the side that wins a huge debt burden and controlled the finance.For this purpose, Thomas Glover of Matheson & Co. was dispatched to Nagasaki, Japan.Japan's invasion of China and its annexation of Korea were also Rothschild's strategies for controlling Asia using Japan and countermeasures against Russia.They invested huge amounts of capital and know-how in order for Japan to advance overseas, and forced Japan to undergo rapid modernization while drowning in debt.This led to the Sino-Japanese War, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and the Russo-Japanese War.For the Russo-Japanese War, the Rothschilds handed over huge amounts of money directly to Japan.That's why Japan won the war, but gave priority to repayment.It is impossible for Japan, which has no resources, to modernize rapidly in a short period of time or to incur a huge invasion equipment cost on its own.World War I consisted mainly of the British and French Rothschild attacks on Germany and Italy.Because it was financially controlled, Japan had to obey even in Asia.Japan would be deprived of Asia's vast resources and assets forever, so it went against it in order to be liberated.Japan aimed at the Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere.So Japan made an alliance with Germany and Italy.American Jews put pressure on Japan to go to war.The United States, knowing in advance, neglected Pearl Harbor to participate in the war, and appealed that the United States was a victim.Neumann and the Jews developed the atomic bomb to drop it on Japan from the beginning.After the war, they claimed they had no intention of dropping it in Japan.Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has long been full of Koreans, delayed Japan's declaration of war and made it appeal overseas that Japan was vicious.Of course, they had leaked various information about Pearl Harbor and other things overseas beforehand.The international financial capital also used the later crushing Soviet Union to fight back against Japan, brainwashing China and Korea into thinking that Japan was a vicious aggressor and perpetrator.China and Korea have been faking history and anti-Japanese education for many years to steal money from Japan.China interferes with the liberation of Asia, conceals various obstructions, and still fakes that it is a massacre and a cruel Japanese army.Japan, which was hesitant to annex it because it would increase its debt, abolished the corrupt royal palace, democratized, and improved the environment.Korea, which wanted to be like Japan and wanted to be annexed, appealed that Korea was a victim after Japan lost.Korea still asks Japan for money for all kinds of fabrications.Japanese who aimed to liberate Asia were judged and executed.Emperor Showa Hirohito apologized to MacArthur to protect the people.In Japan, Koreans have been trying to fabricate history for many years.The atomic bomb was not to destroy the Nazis.",0

Kinda like Agent 47 in the Hitman game series. All of his actions are animated robotically compared to the people around him. He’s a “human” created to kill. All of his conversational lines when in disguise somehow loop back to how to kill somebody or dispose of a body in the current location.

"""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" - Oppenheimer
Oppenheimer later recalled that, while witnessing the explosion, he thought of a verse from the Bhagavad Gita (XI,12):
divi sūryasahasrasya bhavedyugapadutthitā
yadi bhāḥ sadṛṥī sā syādbhāsastasya mahātmanaḥ

""If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky,
that would be like the splendor of the mighty one"".[119]

Years later he said that another verse had also entered his head at that time: ""kālo'smi lokakṣayakṛtpravṛddho lokānsamāhartumiha pravṛttaḥ"" (XI,32),[120] which he translated as ""I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.""[note 2] In 1965, when he was persuaded to quote again for a television broadcast, he said:

We knew the world would not be the same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad Gita; Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form and says, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.",0

I should mention that even the type of violence and the level of it is very bad.

"The 2019 film Joker is about the Joker’s beginnings, how Arthur Fleck developed into his Joker persona. Unlike other portrayals which focus primarily on the violent, murderous criminal that is the Joker, this film is focused more on the mental illness and the effects of society that drove Arthur Fleck to embrace his new identity. This film contains violence but it is violence that it essential to the plot line, thus making the film balanced. According to Infinite Bandwidth by Dr. Eugene Gan, “without balance, without a willingness to look at media from every possible angle, we can’t possibly form right judgements” (22). With the previous quotation in mind, we realize that Joker uses violence to allow the audience to understand just how sick Arthur Fleck is, the movie gives a whole new perspective, even providing a feeling of catharsis for the main character. In the movie, the Joker asks,“What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? You get what you f****n’ deserve!”. This quote makes the audience aware of their own attitude towards mental illness and may inspire reflection on how it is often handled it in our society. A quote from when Arthur is talking to his therapist describes the truth about how so many people who struggle with mental illness may feel: “You don’t listen, do you? You just ask the same question every week...’Are you having any negative thoughts?’ All I have are negative thoughts”. The thought provoking and psychologically thrilling storyline is a skillfully developed way of portraying someone we would typically label a villain, there are both heart-racing action scenes as well as deep topics to later be talked about. Motivated by the shared experience of loneliness, isolation, and a feeling of being misunderstood, Joker pushes audiences to consider the human dignity of all people: ""For My Whole Life, I Didn't Know If I Even Really Existed. But I Do And People Are Starting To Notice”, we can all relate to the feeling that nobody knows we exist.  There are many quotes and phrases throughout the movie that inspire introspection and reflection, so the film is more than pure entertainment. Although he is ultimately a criminal, there are so many aspects of the Joker that we can sympathize with and relate to, as we are all a part of the human race.",0
"This is perhaps, the worst film I have ever seen. Firstly, who in the world thought it was a good idea to have a 3 hour film for a guy to say 5 words.

If there is nothing to keep me in the seat when watching a movie, then it's a bad movie. I'm not talking about few scenes, I'm talking about 30+ minutes of the movie. What happend later, I don't care, as I can expect that the majority of the movie is like beginnig of it. Few good scenes does not make a movie good. And I will repeat again, Oppenheimer deserves much, much better movie than this one.",0

" @dmitrecic  or even better, you get yourself familiar with what you're watching instead of acting oblivious? Would that be an idea? 
If you would understand more than just fractures of the history surrounding Oppenheimer perhaps you wouldn't act like there's no context? 
This advice doesn't matter, it doesn't matter what you think of the first 30 minutes. Judging a movie based on that is objectively impossible. 
Feel free to have an opinion about the movie, but in this case you have literally nothing to base your opinion on, making it quite worthless.",0

"Somewhere in West Philadelphia, you will find an old basketball court with a single ball lying in the middle. Pick it up, and start shooting hoops. After a while, a small group of hooligans will approach you and challenge you to a fight, which you must accept.

After the fight, you must go home and relay the events to your mother. She will then inform you that you have an aunt and uncle living in one of the districts of Los Angeles, and out of fear, she will send you to live there for an indefinite period of time.

With your bags packed, go to the street corner, and whistle for a cab. The cab that pulls up will bear the word “FRESH” on the license plate, and upon closer inspection, novelty fuzzy dice will hang in the mirror. Although you will suddenly realize that cabs like these are extremely hard to find, do not bear any thought to it. At this point, you must point out in front of the car and say “Yo, homes, to Bel Air.”

You will stop in front of a mansion, and it will be sometime between 7 and 8 o’clock, even though it will feel like you have been travelling for mere seconds. Get your luggage out and say “Yo, homes, smell ya later!” but do not turn back to face the cabby. Walk up to the door, look over your shoulder once, and then knock on the door three times.

"Agreed. But, I saw this as the failed attempt to do a different type of trilogy. One that would've been viewed as a Tenet kind of vibe, with less Kung Fu. Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity didn't know how to fight like that until they were virtually programmed to. Morpheus is gone. His program counterpart was code created by Neo, not the Matrix, so martial arts the way machines designed it for Agents MAY not have been similar. The machines repaired Neo and Trinity on a biological level, so that COULD HAVE included wiping their slates cleaned on some of their uploaded abilities. Neo's powers as The One they couldn't eradicate, thus choosing to use it against him. Accompanied by Trinity's anomalous empowerment towards it, they were able to give us the old Thomas Anderson before he became Neo. It's almost as if they reset the events of the first trilogy, and now we have the hacker programmer we were first introduced to, but with suppressed memories and the unshaven John Wick look. Bear in mind, Keanu and Carrie-Anne aren't in their 30s anymore, so martial arts stunts are limited. There should've been MUCH MORE gun fights though. Granted, it would've felt more like John Wick in the Matrix, but I wouldn't have cared. The one element I thought was dumb was bringing back Smith's presence. He was virus who was removed. End of story. Give us a new antagonist",0

"such a disappointment such a waste of time and I can't believe they're going to create another one with the same disappointing writers and directors the previous episodes. we all know their original matrix is still the best and unless they return and film the movie comparable to that caliber, this too will bomb and not even worth watching",0
Trash this filmed destroyed the movies before this !!! Everything story line all the new cast everything was horrible!! Every time I see anything related to this new matrix i can’t help but think about what Lilly Wachowski  was thinking!! I remember in an interview she had long lost her parents and it was grieve that made her go back to the matrix and she asked her sister to join in the project but declined to take part of it ! That should be of been a red flag !! I mean this only my opinion sometime when dealing with some mental or family crisis our mines aren’t in the right state of mind !  This is an excellent way of why it isn’t a good idea to do major decisions when going through some major changes in your life,0

"These were incredible movies. But if there’s one thing I want Secret Wars to improve on it’s the length of the final battle.
1. Endgame had a huge final battle with everyone there. It was great, but the entire sequence lasts 11 mins, which isn’t bad but it got right to the point fairly quick and skimmed over several characters who were there.
2. Endgame’s finale feels and is much faster than Infinity War’s, you’d think it’d be opposite.
3. Doomsday will likely have a big final battle with many characters, but I assume that Secret Wars will be a far bigger one with everybody, somewhat replicating Endgame having everybody of its time. 
4. So I hope that if Secret Wars has a huge final battle with everybody present, that they make it longer than Endgame’s (from the point everybody on both sides arrived for war). A few thoughts:
- A long single cut (1 min or so) spanning across the battle field that shows everyone doing something
- Make sure everybody is shown in action (Endgame skipped several who were there but didn’t have action on screen)
- Endgame’s was 11 mins, I hope Secret Wars finale is closer to 25-30 because it’ll have more characters and is a bigger finale",0

DDBA, I'm definitely watching this, something that is ACTUALLY good. Ironheart, I can't begin to explain how unnecessary and how bad it feels; the character of Riri has like no personality at all, she's not relatable, she's not interesting, she's more of a plot device, etc. I'm not trying to ruin it for you.

""The Matrix"" is much more than a mere action movie. It's replete with symbolism and meta-analysis about society, existence, and philosophical themes that require repertoire to understand

The bots concept, the archictect as a therapist, the blue pill as a medication, emotion as a form of control, the duality of Neo and Trinity, the synthient machines fighting each other, the matrix as a game right in front of people, the merovigian as a beggar and pissed of about this new superficial society, etc.

All of this has meaning and correlation with current times

IMO lots of people hated the movie cause they are in denial that matrix is actually talking about our era and our current problems

Even Keanu Reeves himself told Lana that she nailed the story of the first trilogy talking about the 2000s and now she has done the same talking about 2020 +",0

"This movie is generational. This is where the MCU peaked. Infinity War is objectively a better movie, but Endgame is the best MCU project. It understood what Infinity War was, understood that the Snap was going to change the MCU forever. Memorials were raised. Lives were upended. People lost everything and that broke the world. Then Phase 4 comes around and everything is back to normal. 

They should've spent all of Phase 4 continuing this tone of change and defeat. Screw the Multiverse, street level consequences would flesh out the world much more. What supervillains have risen in the 5 years? What superheroes have? How will society handle 3.5 billion people coming back at once? How has street crime changed? What will happen when the snapped crime boss comes back to take his seat? There's so much to say, but instead we get dumb jokes like ""Infinity Cones"" and an immediate jump to the Next Big Thing with no thought behind how attached we are to the Next Big Thing",0

"Thursday, October 31st. The city streets are crowded for the holiday. Even with the rain. Hidden in the chaos is the element, waiting to strike like snakes. And I'm there too. Watching. 2 years of nights have turned me into a nocturnal animal. I must choose my targets carefully. It's a big city. I can't be everywhere. But they don't know where I am. We have a signal now, for when I'm needed. When that light hits the sky, it's not just a call- it's a warning. To them. Fear is a tool. They think I'm hiding in the shadows. But I AM the shadows. I wish I could say I'm making a difference, but I don't know. Murder, robberies, assault- 2 years later, they're all up. And now this. This city's eating itself. Maybe it can't be saved, but i have to try. PUSH MYSELF. These nights all roll together in a rush, Behind the mask. Sometimes in the morning i have to force myself to remember everything that happened.",0

It's a crime that Dumbo and The Aristocats were removed from Disney+, on that note: there is a way of still appreciating an old piece of media without ignoring its flaws and learning from them instead of endorsing this crazy censorship, which solves nothing and erases important parts of animation history. Which is unconscionable imo. Ignoring any part of history just because it becomes inconvenient in a later time period is just pathetic.🤷🏻‍♀️",0

Instead of bitching about what you don't have, be grateful on what you do have. OR, a simpler conclusion, don't watch Disney related things if it bothers you shit heads that much.

"Well it sure wasn't made for the sake of me, the audience member who had no knowledge of it before watching it. It was very slow and very boring. A lot of the world building makes absolutely no sense (they have wormholes, spaceships and physically impossible ornithopter things but fight with swords and act like a bronze age culture?). A lot of the story components are basically exact copies of stuff from Star Wars, Batman Begins, The Avengers, and others. Certain parts of this film were spectacular, but it had severe, and I mean SEVERE storytelling flaws. Its biggest storytelling flaw was that it didn't make me care. That's the worst possible offense. Nothing happened in the first hour. It didn't perform well at the box office, many audience members thought it was too slow and boring, and it really only appeals to a niche audience. It's not a masterpiece.

Also, the biology of the sand worms makes absolutely no sense at all. The more scarce the water/food and the harsher the environment, the smaller the organisms. And this world has organisms the size of 100 blue whales living in the middle of the desert? WTF? That's not how biology works.

Too bad those explicit scenes have limited the audience for this very relevant film.

Why indulge in something so petty and common as sex when the truth of Atomic devastation could have been depicted explicitly?

Too Political?

Too offensive?

Unprofitable?

Why not EDUCATE people so we DO NOT FORGET?!

There's an ocean of new, independent music out there so there's no excuse to keep using the same songs we've heard a million times. Other than that, this movie also looks painfully cheesy.

Not just that movie, but there are more projects coming after, though i forget the name of them (Are we going to forget Soul, Moana, etc.which are original in their own right exist?). To say they're not making original content anymore is both an understatement and an overstatement... I don't want to get heated about it, I just want to argue that what you say isn't entirely true.

 @superstag 1 might be the fact that the directors didn’t want to do this movie in the first place. They may or may not had made the movie bad on purpose so it would flop so WB would stop pressuring them to make new movies. I know it might sound counterintuitive but WB was going to make this movie with or without the old directors so they decided to kill it in their own vision. That’s just a theory going around and what the person above might suggest.,0

Thus making us slaves to our own emotions, ergo limitating the bonds that makes us humans. What we would call the devils playground, portrayed by the malevolent analyst, we must question our reality as to why we are all in this state of anguish and pain. Could it be that our savior(s) trapped in a parralel world, where we must first access to free them and humanity ? Thats is the quintessential essence of this movie.",0

"State an hypothesis that a scientist in movies is either evil or killed as a good guy henchman as a trope because the scientist is perceived as a modern materialist as compared to the noble savage or the knight in Armor? Give 5 lines
The scientist in movies is often portrayed as either evil or sacrificed as a good guy henchman due to the prevailing trope that associates them with modern materialism. This stereotype contrasts with the romanticized ideals of the noble savage or the knight in armor, embodying a clash between progress and tradition in storytelling. The scientist's pursuit of knowledge and technological advancements is frequently depicted as a threat to the natural order, perpetuating a narrative that resonates with broader societal anxieties about scientific progress and its potential consequences. This trope reflects a dichotomy between scientific rationality and more traditional, heroic archetypes, shaping audience perceptions of characters in these roles.

", ""Oppenheimer"",  it's clear that it's another glorification of the architects of destruction. It's a tale spun by the industrial ruling class, a narrative that paints the creators of the most devastating weapon in human history as heroes. But let's not forget, these are the same minds that have brought us to the brink of self-destruction, the same minds that have poisoned the Navajo Nation with their unending radioactive spill.

The industrial ruling class and their nuclear energy tell us a story of progress and power, but what they don't tell us is the cost.

You look on any of those trailers and you see everybody's just as lost as the people who have created this system. They just speak of the movie itself but not that it has a stark impact on our lives as human beings"". But they had become so assimilated they no longer can tell the difference",1

"Oppenheimer's parents pushed for him to get to the Cavendish laboratory at Cambridge in about 1924 and the pushiness and some money got him a place.  When he and his mother docked at Southampton he saw two people kissing and took the man's place and tried to kiss the woman.  Then he dropped a suitcase on her head.  When he got to Cambridge he was told he had to make his own equipment for the particle physics experimental work he was doing under Rutherford, which he hated because it was too hard for him to do, and was taken to task about it by Patrick Blackett.  Oppenheimer went on holiday with a friend to France and confessed he left a poisoned apple on Blackett's desk!  Rutherford had to contct his parents and between them got Oppenheimer psychiatric treatment

Also while in Cambridge his mother set him up with a ""suitable"" woman to lose his virginity to, and harangued them outside the door during the act

That's how Oppenheimer knew about the extensive British research being done because of Rutherford and the Cavendish, far further on than anything Berkeley had at the time.

So because of this, Roosevelt got in MAUD and Tube Alloys, with Chadwick, Cockcroft and Walton, Blaxkett and Thomson, told Churchill it was for collaboration purposea and then shut the British out.  So America only has itself to blame for Fuchs

"The next movie I have in mind is titled Joker: Umbra Chiroptera. In this story, Batman takes on his first mission, trying to stop the Joker and Harley Quinn. The title 'Umbra Chiroptera' translates to 'Shadow of the Bat' in Latin, symbolizing Batman's emergence from the shadows as he begins his endless psychological battle with the Joker. The movie would dive deep into their twisted dynamic, full of mental tricks, traps, and the dark journey that defines their conflict.",1

The scene where Manzhulika picks up a man and throws it is generally a catastrophe, horror, how can such a film be spoiled with such terrible unprofessional scenes.

"Abomination, that is the best way to define this film. There is nothing remotely recognizable in most of these characters (not even the way their names are pronounced) or the the plot points when compared to the source material. Some of the changes are so far fetched they are anger inducing. No spoilers here, suffice it to say this is NOT Frank Herbert's Dune. Aside from the visuals of the worlds and the soundtrack I didn't like much of anything about this film. This train has gone so far off the rails it can't come back. I wish I were capable of ignoring the source material as a viewer the way the writers and director have done. Then I might've enjoyed it.
I have read most of the Dune series three times. A few of them more, so it it difficult to unlearn or to unknow and to just go with the flow of these films.
As is the case for many Books and Novels adapted for TV and film... ignorance is bliss.",1

I'm sorry it's December 2023 and it still breaks my heart. This guy loves her so much. And this is before we even knew that Morgan existed. Before we knew he died when Morgan was so little. The saddest movie ever seen in my life. If I had driven home instead of taking the bus I would have crashed from being unable to see. Absolutely unreal.

But the sound was magnificent.",1

Whoever wrote the script is not very smart or is on drugs.  The film's rating is below rock bottom.👎",1

"This movie was so dumb and woke. Of course they couldn't have Neo be the star anymore and had to make Trinity ""half"" of the main hero. Not to mention the little magic carpet girl from the original trilogy being important for no reason. Oh ya and woke loser 'hero's' besides Neo as well. What a complete piece of garbage. And of course the dude directors decided to start dressing as woman after getting a mental illness. All seems about right.",1

" Elementary Watson  Your assertion is also debatable. One could argue that when George says ""what writer? we are talking about a sitcom!"", he is indeed really talking about the sitcom the viewer is watching and tries to slowly make Seinfeld accept the fact that they are in a sitcom, without being too obvious to not break Seinfeld's mind (Imagine someone suddenly saying you are in some sort of Truman Show! You would collapse in tears!)",1
"anyone hating on this movie didnt understand it at all. 
its incredible how they managed to continue writing more to the story when the end of the third movie seemed to have brought the whole story to a definitive conclusion.
even more, the fact that they actually made it relevant to modern times gives it a genuine freshness, while also keeping elements of nostalgia.
cant really get why people got upset for trinity getting on the same level as neo, after all both characters complement each other. certainly the oracle knew that since she knew the prophecy.",1

"I disagree... 2 and 3 still aren't great movies, but you can watch them in retrospect without the hype and expectations and at a minimum see a conclusion to Neo's arc with some fun fights. This movie essentially begrudgingly dragged Neo out of retirement and invented a problem that previously didn't exist so a bunch of zoomer hackers could watch him Force Push his way out of every situation. It's not going to be any more compelling in 5, 10, or 20 years.",1

America the country that begs the world to not use nuclear bombs but has been the only country to use them not once but twice.,2
"I am Japanese.
I went to see this movie as soon as it was finally released in Japan.
I am a fan of director Christopher Nolan, and I was very interested in this movie because it is about the atomic bombing.
In conclusion, I thought this was a film worth seeing.
There are some scenes that affirm the atomic bombing, such as the city of Los Alamos celebrating after the bombing. (Well, I think it is natural for people to celebrate the bombing, considering what was happening at the time. It would be strange if they didn't.)
On the other hand, the film depicted the process of making the A-bomb, the experiments, and the selection of the drop site, which could never be depicted in Japan, and above all, Oppenheimer's anguish and regret over having created such a terrible thing were very interesting.
Despite this, some viewers see this film as glorifying the atomic bomb, but I don't know why they would think so.
What if Japan and the U.S. were in opposite positions? What if they had chosen not to use the atomic bombs?
Regarding the former, I think Japan would have used the A-bomb on the U.S. Regarding the latter, mainland Japan would have been the battlefield, my ancestors would have died, and I might not be here today.
As long as we cannot look into another world line, this is neither the best nor the worst outcome.
Whether it is good or bad, I personally think that it was an unavoidable choice considering what was happening at the time, and I believe that this choice is the reason we are here today.
Please note that this is the opinion of me, a tiny Japanese person, and not of other Japanese people, people in Hiroshima or Nagasaki, people related to the Hibakusha, or the Hibakusha themselves.

Finally, Einstein alone had a different aura about him, and even though he did not make many appearances, I got excited every time he came out.
Without Einstein, the atomic bomb might never have been created. But Einstein is also popular in Japan as a synonym for scientific genius.

"As someone who has traveled to the ME. The setting, the garb, the use of Arabic and Muslim religious constructs throughout the film are groundbreaking. The resemblance of the Fremen people to the Bedouins is uncanny. The allusions to the Middle East are unmistakable, especially as the novel came on the heels of the oil boom in the Gulf states. Frank Herbert’s editors initially asked him to tone down the “Muslim flavor” of his book. Trying to avoid Herbert’s apparent insensitivity, the filmmakers actively subdued most elements of Islam, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The new movie treats religion, ecology, capitalism and colonialism as broad abstractions, stripped of particularity.",2

米戦略爆弾調査は 1946年7月
トルーマン大統領に 
｢日本の戦争終結努力｣と題する報告を提出した
日本指導部との面接調査を基にしたこの報告は 単なる 流言とされていた降伏の打診が 
かなり早い時点から しばしば行われていたことを確認している
同報告によれば 1944年2月には 日本指導部の多くが この戦争には勝てないと判断し 妥協による和平努力を主張している しかも この｢妥協による和平｣は日本の戦前の地位を引き上げようというものではなかった むしろ 高木惣吉海軍少将は 日本は朝鮮と台湾の放棄を前提にして 交渉すべきであると主張していたのだ

1945年2月には早くも 和平打診に関する情報がアメリカの新聞で報道されている
当時 この提案は 公式に無視 ないしは否定されたが ようやく その事実を裏付ける 証拠が出てきた 3月には日本政府が和平交渉の可能性を模索していたことは事実だ 交渉は中国を仲介者とし 1931年以前の国境線を基礎にするものだった そして 同年5月までに駐ソ連日本大使は ｢結果がいかなるものであれ 『戦前の条件より後退したものであっても』それを前提に可能な和平提案を協議するよう訓令を受けている これほど早い時期に 日本政府内部で降伏を唱える人々が影響力を持ち始めていたことを 米戦略爆撃調査報告は確認しているのだ 同報告によれば
｢天皇、枢密院議長、首相、外相、海相は 1945年5月に 連合国の条件による敗戦を受け入れることになっても 戦争は終結させなければならないとの結論に達していた｣
いまや政府内部の主導権を握った和平派は こうした大きな支持を得て この月のうちに具体的な行動を起こした
すでに見たように モスクワ駐在日本大使は交渉打診の訓令を受けていた
そして 近衛公を交渉のためモスクワに送ることも計画された できれば無条件降伏より緩い条件を期待してはいたが いずれにしても 和平のための交渉だった

日本政府は少なくとも 1945年5月(V・Jデーの3ヶ月前)に降伏の打診をしているが
この打診は米政府によって公式に無視 あるいは拒否された
事実 1944年の早い段階から
日本政府の内部では完全敗北と みなしうる条件の受け入れが 真剣に検討されていたのだ

 @trevorriches136  CGI,2
" @SMOOVKILL1  forgive me, but now I am a little confused. “Oppenheimer” director Christopher Nolan is known for being very much against the use of CGI whenever he can help it. His role is that if it can be practical, it will be practical. There were actually no entirely computer-generated shots in “Oppenheimer”.",2
Disney have been quiet ever since this movie dropped,2
сахаров создатель водородной бомбы  может тоже премию оскар,2
🥱,2
It's a biopic,2
The movie is a biopic about Oppenheimer. It's based on the biography American Prometheus by Martin J. Sherwin and Kai Bird.,2
"Oppenheim: It is a puzzling, dreadful story that waffles on and on without the true science fiction and technology of concocting the atomic bomb. This cinematic story was all over the place, an amalgamation of intricate and twisted plots, making it tough for any viewers to comprehend and digest. It is somewhat sketchy on top of ambiguous around the storyline I must say.

This film started off being humdrum with a group of people gathering around a table, interrogating Oppenheim about his motives and intentions for creating this atomic bomb. I was initially enthralled with how the film goes back and forth between the past as well as the future but was let down as the story rolled on. 

Besides that, the director wasn’t ingenious enough to make things straight and go to great lengths to push forward his storyline in a practical manner. Somehow, it turned out that the narratives didn’t put much effort into unraveling the true essence of how Oppenheim invented the bomb, but merely a touch of the bomb test and a slight whiff of his love story. 

Moreover, it was horrendous that he was shattered a little after his lover left him without much emphasis on it. The storyline isn’t for everyone due to its convoluted and complex structure as well and it takes a lionheart to delve deep into discerning the true significance of this tale. Anticipating that the movie would end up with the drop of the atomic bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, it kept on going monotonously along the lines. A dreary and bland movie isn’t all that is in this film, but also a conundrum that is not discerned profoundly. At the climax of the story, the director diverged into a different perspective in order to drill on for three hours with the narrative running into each other and scattered all over the place. 

By the time the director brought the prestigious Albert Einstein out into the picture, it was the middle of the story with barely a glimpse, and he had decided to wind up the whole movie. I am aware of this firm’s trajectory to cast back the historical moments of ‘Oppenheim: Father of Death,’ but this tale is devoid of interesting and engaging scenes. 

Way to go, Nolan! You completely trash this movie with this awful film. It certainly doesn't live up to his reputation - A below-mediocre, despicable film that is. Don’t even spend your valuable time looking over at this film. Only a deluded, deranged person would enjoy this type of mundane movie.",2

"Пора говорить ПРЯМО. ВСЁ ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ , имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА , либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА , либо дьяволу. Служить БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит , каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. ""ПРИВОДИТЬ"" НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ к ПОКАЯНИЮ, СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ, и соответственно наоборот, максимально удалять от него. 

МЕРЗКОЕ сатанинское КИНО. Под видом исторического сюжета скрывается обычная ДЬЯВОЛЬСКАЯ НАСМЕШКА И пример МАНИПУЛЯЦИИ душой человека, а ПОЧЕМУ надо понимать следующее. НО СНАЧАЛА. Любое УПОМИНАНИЕ в фильме О БОГЕ, ВСУЕ(что значит обращения к Богу без молитвы и благовейного состояния), а главное название этой небогоугодной операции это обычное БОГОХУЛЬСТВО(ХУЛА на ДУХА СВЯТОГО), самый СТРАШНЫЙ ГРЕХ если прельститься. НО БОГА ОБИДЕТЬ НЕ ВОЗМОЖНО ОН БЕССТРАСТЕН, А вот ХУЛА ЕГО это БОЛЬШОЙ ГРЕХ. А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ. РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ мучителей, БЕСОВ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола. Сам же ФИЛЬМ НАМЕРЕННО «РАЗЖИГАЕТ», но В ДУШАХ самих ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, действие множества СТРАШНЫХ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ таких как ЛУКАВСТВО, ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ЛЮДСКОЙ СЛАВЕ), ПОХОТЬ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ГНЕВ, НЕНАВИСТЬ, МЕСТЬ, ВИНОПИТИЕ, и КУРЕНИЕ. И ВОТ ТАК, ОГРОМНОЕ БОЛЬШИНСТВО ЛЮДЕЙ, ВОЛЬНО ИЛИ НЕ ВОЛЬНО СОГРЕШАЮТ(не вольно значит что, грех только у себя в уме, под действием той или иной порочной страсти, является таким же грехом), И ДЬЯВОЛ «ВВОДИТ» В ДУШУ человека ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ разных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ. Ну А «ОБЩЕНИЕ» человека в жизни С любым ДЕМОНОМ, «ПРИВЕДЁТ» рано или поздно только к одному, или К ПСИХИЧЕСКОМУ РАССТРОЙСТВУ, или УБИЙСТВУ, или САМОУБИЙСТВУ. И к АДУ для ДУШИ после физической СМЕРТИ тела. И ПОЧЕМУ МАНИПУЛЯЦИЯ. «ПРИОРИТЕТНЫМ» демоном который завладевает душой человека при просмотре фильма, если конечно он уже не находится в душе, а если находится тогда усиливается бесами соответствующей порочной страсти, потому что он фактически из них и состоит, БУДЕТ ДЕМОН МУЧИТЕЛЬ КУРЕНИЯ, ПОТОМУ ЧТО КАК реально примерно ВЫГЛЯДИТ ЭТОТ ДЕМОН в своём «человеческом» виде ПОКАЗАНО В этом ФИЛЬМЕ. А что касается этого демона. С развитием эры электронных сигарет ЭТА ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ становится СТРАШНЫМ ОРУЖИЕМ МЕСТИ в руках ДЬЯВОЛА против человека. Дело в том что в них можно устанавливать небольшое взрывное устройство. И тогда одна затяжка приведёт к тому что лицо человека станет похожем на лицо чудовища из фильма хищник когда он в конце снял свою маску. И ВОТ как БЫЛО БЫ ХОРОШО, ЧТОБЫ КАЖДЫЙ зритель ПОНИМАЛ это. НО ЭТО очень «тонкие» моменты, ПОНЯТЬ которые МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.

Да и ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ это ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ, ЛУКАВСТВО, СЕБЯЛЮБИЕ, ТРУСОСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ЖАДНОСТЬ, ОСУЖДЕНИЕ, АЛЧНОСТЬ, СКУПОСТЬ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ, ЛИЦЕМЕРИЕ, УНЫНИЕ, ЧРЕВОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, РЕВНОСТЬ, ВОРОВСТВО, РАЗДРАЖЕНИЕ, ВЛАСТОЛЮБИЕ, ПОХОТЬ, ЛЮБОПЫТСТВО, ПЬЯНСТВО, КУРЕНИЕ, ПРЕЛЮБОДЕЯНИЕ, ОБИДЧИВОСТЬ, ЗАСТЕНЧИВОСТЬ, ХИТРОСТЬ, РАССЕЯННОСТЬ и т.д. и т.п. И у КАЖДОГО ЧЕЛОВЕКА своя(СТРАСТЬ), так сказать, ЛИЧНАЯ. И ЭТО всё БОЛЕЗНИ, но БОЛЕЗНИ ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.

А ПОЧЕМУ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. После ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА и ЕВЫ они были ИЗГНАНЫ ИЗ РАЯ. ДО грехопадения они ЖИЛИ В РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и ДАЛ ЗАПОВЕДЬ «ПЛОДИТЕСЬ и РАЗМНОЖАЙТЕСЬ» и заселяйте Землю. НО для размножения, В ПОЛОВЫЕ ОТНОШЕНИЯ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ ВСТУПАТЬ БРАТУ С СЕСТРОЙ. И ЭТО было вызвано необходимостью а НЕ ПОХОТЬЮ. И ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КАЖДЫЙ рождающийся ребёнок уже ГРЕШЕН.  Только не физическое(физическое если вызвано похотью, между родными братьями и сёстрами), а так называемое ПЕРВОРОДНОЕ (ДУХОВНОЕ , ПРИЧИНА которого ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЕ) ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ(ГРЕХ, ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ) НА КАЖДОМ человеке при рождении. И У КАЖДОГО человека своя СОБСТВЕННАЯ СТРАСТЬ. И ЭТО БОЛЕЗНЬ, но БОЛЕЗНЬ прежде всего ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  И именно ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ людей являются ПРИЧИНОЙ ВСЕХ БЕД, СТРАДАНИЙ, и РАЗРУШИТЕЛЬНЫХ ДЕЙСТВИЙ на Земле. А вот условия ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЯ ОТ этого ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ, СТРАСТИ) как раз и ЗАПИСАНЫ в КНИГЕ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОМ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. НО СНАЧАЛА , чтобы донести их людям,  сам СЫН, БОГ СЛОВО ВОЧЕЛОВЕЧИЛСЯ(ИИСУС ХРИСТОС, имя ИИСУС означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ). А ЕГО за это РАСПЯЛИ. Но ОСТАЛОСЬ СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. Вот ЭТО и есть БОЖЕСТВЕННЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ , во первых ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ ОТ ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(а правильней сказать от ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ), И во вторых ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ДУШИ человеческой, ПОЛУЧЕНИЯ ЖИЗНИ ВЕЧНОЙ для ДУШИ, ПОСЛЕ физической СМЕРТИ тела , В ЦАРСТВИЕ НЕБЕСНОМ.

И поэтому ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.

Ну И ЕСЛИ каждый человек захочет ""БОРОТЬСЯ"" СО своими ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, ТО для начала, НУЖНО ПОВЕРИТЬ В БОГА, ПРЕСВЯТУЮ ТРОИЦУ: ОТЦА(СОЗДАТЕЛЯ ВСЕГО ЖИВОГО И НЕ ЖИВОГО, ВИДИМОГО мира и НЕВИДИМОГО),через СЫНА БОГА СЛОВО(ИИСУСА ХРИСТА), СВЯТОГО ДУХА. 

А ЧТОБЫ  ""ПРИЙТИ"" к БОГУ или ПОЗНАТЬ БОГА необходимо ПОКАЯНИЕ.  

Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что ЗАПИСАНО выше, И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ осталось очень МАЛО, ВОЗМОЖНО даже примерно 7 месяцев, И ВСЁ(смотри СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ от МАТФЕЯ, ГЛ. 24)) СДЕЛАТЬ ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ ""шагом"" будет (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋🏻",2

Where I can see this movie ?,2
I watched it on IMAX last week. Had goosebumps throughout the movie.,2
🪢Props,2
And the trailer didn't even come close to depicting how utterly spectacular this film was 😮,2
"Spoiler warning!
1. See it for yourself. 
2. I understand why Japan boycotted it. They didn't show nearly enough respect to the victims. I kept wondering when were they going to show respect to the victims. 
3. It was underwhelming but very well acted. It wasn't because it was a biopic. Id have to guess Nolan didn't want the bomb and its destruction to be the big action of the movie. Almost exploiting it to sell ""action"" . So, i can respect that because of the lives that were lost.",2

" @lancevanceGTA  I did see it, and it’s not boring, while it is long, it still shows you important aspects of history, and teaches uneducated people about the horrors of atomic bombs, sure, it doesn’t show the impact of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, but you get the idea if you have a decent knowledge of basic history, I’m gonna assume you left the theaters 1 hour in",2

" @sp9459  sure! It was when he was in ‘Leiden’, thats a dutch city indeed. He gave a college. A gentlemen next to him said to his neighbour that he would translate what oppenheimer said because he assumed Oppenheimer would speak english. Then Oppenheimer started to speak, what sounded like german. Im not even fully convinced it was german either tho…i learned german for 6 years, and dutch is my native language, and i couldnt understand at all what he was saying. I was like wtf is this 🤣",2
Cope harder,2

​ @anneyo5627 it was Dutch but it's very incomprehensible. If you have the subtitles in front of you while seeing that scene it makes a lot more sense.,2

"As someone who has traveled to the ME. The setting, the garb, the use of Arabic and Muslim religious constructs throughout the film are groundbreaking. The resemblance of the Fremen people to the Bedouins is uncanny. The allusions to the Middle East are unmistakable, especially as the novel came on the heels of the oil boom in the Gulf states. Frank Herbert’s editors initially asked him to tone down the “Muslim flavor” of his book. Trying to avoid Herbert’s apparent insensitivity, the filmmakers actively subdued most elements of Islam, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The new movie treats religion, ecology, capitalism and colonialism as broad abstractions, stripped of particularity.",2

Are you talking about the expression on Stilgar's face at 1:47? That look is because Stilgar finally believes that it must be true - that Paul really is the Lisan al Gaib (his mind is blown). Before he rides the worm they're pretty sure he is...but not quite 100% confident. Once he rides the sandworm (especially the size of the one he rides) there is no doubt at that point.,2

I don’t understand the artistic choice to make every Harkonnen bald,2
All the deep thoughts in those characters heads from the books cannot be translated into to mere facial expressions with a few lines of dialogue.  Most adapations are very much the style of the thing over the substance of the thing. The books fans will get more out of the Dune movies as they can fill in the movie gaps with book lore.,2

Say you’re the 1990s without saying you’re the 1990s,2
"Definitely going to see the film, but not a fan of the music in the trailer; it feels too triumphant, like it would belong to a film about putting the first man on the moon rather than unlocking the means to destroy ourselves.

"Just watched Nolan's Oppenheimer. It's like, way more of an anti-war flick than a straight-up biography. I mean, history will remember Oppenheimer as the dude who birthed the nuclear bomb, but is that what he really wanted to be remembered for? The whole movie tackles that question head-on. There's this one sick line where he's like, ""I've got blood on my hands."" He created something hella awful that ended up snuffing out the lives of over two hundred thousand people in Fukushima and Nagasaki. In the movie, it's clear as day that Oppenheimer can't revel in being called the ""father of the nuclear bomb"" or bask in his fame. 'Cause he's got that gnawing guilt inside him that messes with his moral compass. Can Oppenheimer ever find forgiveness? I guess it's on him to forgive himself, and we'll never really know the answer to that question.",2

H0llyw00d this days don't want people thinking. But as many noted here, the tariler is a blast, its amazingly put toghther, and it lets u imagine a diffrent movie then the end result.",2

"Пора говорить ПРЯМО. ВСЁ ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ, ЖИВОПИСЬ имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА , либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА , либо дьяволу. СЛУЖИТЬ БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит , каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. ""ПРИВОДИТЬ"" НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ к ПОКАЯНИЮ, СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ, и соответственно наоборот, максимально удалять от него. 

МЕРЗКОЕ сатанинское КИНО. ДЬЯВОЛЬСКАЯ НАСМЕШКА, И пример МАНИПУЛЯЦИИ человеком, а ПОЧЕМУ надо понимать следующее. ФИЛЬМ прежде всего НАМЕРЕННО «РАЗЖИГАЕТ», но В ДУШАХ самих ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, действие множества ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, таких как ГОРДЫНЯ, ЛУКАВСТВО, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ЛЮДСКОЙ СЛАВЕ), ГНЕВ, НЕНАВИСТЬ, МЕСТЬ, ТЯГА К АЛКОГОЛЮ, ЧРЕВОУГОДИЕ. А ЭТО всё ГРЕХИ. А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ. РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ, БЕСОВ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола. И вот ТАК ОГРОМНОЕ БОЛЬШИНСТВО ЛЮДЕЙ, ВОЛЬНО ИЛИ НЕ ВОЛЬНО СОГРЕШАЮТ (не вольно значит что, грех только у себя в уме, под действием той или иной порочной страсти, является таким же грехом), И ДЬЯВОЛ «ВВОДИТ»  В ДУШУ человека ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ разных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ. Ну А «ОБЩЕНИЕ» человека в жизни С любым ДЕМОНОМ, «ПРИВЕДЁТ» рано или поздно только к одному, или К ПСИХИЧЕСКОМУ РАССТРОЙСТВУ, или УБИЙСТВУ, или САМОУБИЙСТВУ. И к АДУ для ДУШИ после физической СМЕРТИ тела. А что касается сюжета фильма, то показано что будет с человеком одержимым демонами мучителями лукавства, потому что их в душе человека два. Эти немыслимо бессмысленные фантазии приведут сначала к психическому расстройству, депрессии. Таблетки не помогут. А вот что помогает, как покажется самому человеку, будет употребление наркотиков, или алкоголя. Но это большая ошибка. Употребление этих веществ на самом деле приведёт человека к фатальным последствиям. Под влиянием наркотиков(когда сознание человека будет ещё больше помрачено), действие демонов мучителей лукавства, их фантазии, приведут человека либо к убийству, либо к самоубийству, ну и естественно к аду для души. А в аду у каждого человека будет своя личная «видеоигра». И не стоит никому рассчитывать на какие либо благоприятные условия. Там будет только плач и скрежет зубов. А ПОЧЕМУ фильм МАНИПУЛЯЦИЯ. «ПРИОРИТЕТНЫМ» демоном который завладевает душой человека после просмотра фильма БУДЕТ, ДЕМОН МУЧИТЕЛЬ ПРИВЛЕКАЮЩИЙ человека К всякой БЕСОВЩИНЕ. ПОТОМУ ЧТО КАК реально примерно ВЫГЛЯДИТ ЭТОТ ДЕМОН ПОКАЗАНО В ФИЛЬМЕ.  Но И ЗАЩИТА тоже существует. ЕСЛИ СОГРЕШИЛ (даже только в мыслях, в данном случае почувствовал проявление этих пороков), надо сразу же ПРОИЗНОСИТЬ МОЛИТВУ ГОСПОДА нашего ИИСУСА ХРИСТА. «ГОСПОДИ ИИСУСЕ ХРИСТЕ СЫНЕ БОЖИЙ СПАСИ И ПОМИЛУЙ МЕНЯ ГРЕШНОГО». Стопроцентно помогает.  И ВОТ как БЫЛО БЫ ХОРОШО, ЧТОБЫ КАЖДЫЙ зритель ПОНИМАЛ это. НО ЭТО очень «тонкие» моменты, ПОНЯТЬ которые МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.

Да и ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ это ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ, ЛУКАВСТВО, СЕБЯЛЮБИЕ, ТРУСОСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ЖАДНОСТЬ, ОСУЖДЕНИЕ, АЛЧНОСТЬ, СКУПОСТЬ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ, ЛИЦЕМЕРИЕ, УНЫНИЕ, ЧРЕВОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, РЕВНОСТЬ, ВОРОВСТВО, РАЗДРАЖЕНИЕ, ВЛАСТОЛЮБИЕ, ПОХОТЬ, ЛЮБОПЫТСТВО, ПЬЯНСТВО, КУРЕНИЕ, ПРЕЛЮБОДЕЯНИЕ, ОБИДЧИВОСТЬ, ЗАСТЕНЧИВОСТЬ, ХИТРОСТЬ, РАССЕЯННОСТЬ и т.д. и т.п. И у КАЖДОГО ЧЕЛОВЕКА своя(СТРАСТЬ), так сказать, ЛИЧНАЯ. И  ЭТО всё БОЛЕЗНИ(а почему мы все «больны», это тема для отдельной беседы), но БОЛЕЗНИ ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.

И ГЛАВНОЕ. ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.

Ну И ЕСЛИ каждый человек захочет ""БОРОТЬСЯ"" СО своими ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ , ТО для начала, НУЖНО ПОВЕРИТЬ В БОГА, ПРЕСВЯТУЮ ТРОИЦУ: ОТЦА(СОЗДАТЕЛЯ ВСЕГО ЖИВОГО И НЕ ЖИВОГО, ВИДИМОГО мира и НЕ ВИДИМОГО),через СЫНА БОГА СЛОВО(ИИСУСА ХРИСТА), СВЯТОГО ДУХА. 

А ЧТОБЫ  ""ПРИЙТИ"" к БОГУ или ПОЗНАТЬ БОГА необходимо ПОКАЯНИЕ.  

Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что написано выше , И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ осталось очень МАЛО, возможно даже примерно 1 МЕСЯЦ, И ВСЁ(смотри СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ от МАТФЕЯ, ГЛ. 24)) СДЕЛАТЬ при ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ ""шагом"" будет (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋🏻",2

I think they should give it one more go. Totally new approach. New dharacters but not a neo storyline. Maybe someone inadvertently breaks through the veil and raises followers who take it down somehow from the inside out,2

There are no spells made by mouth to transform reality, or maybe your mother asking you to clean your room. :)",2

So wait okay Matrix 3 Neo defeats The Matrix brings peace and ends the war now the only reason that you would have a fourth Matrix is if what we think is a perception of the good guys is really the Matrix putting us back into the Matrix cuz there is no reason for a new movie unless they're wanting to put real life people who has escaped The Matrix and the hive mind thinking unless it was made to put us back into the Matrix,2

"The whole video is wonderful, but the mixing of lyrics and imagery from 1:49 to 2:27 is simply amazing:

""When logic and proportion"" (Bugs flips off the roof, landing onto the side of the building and smashing concrete - synced with the word proportion - followed by Agents taking over police) 

""have fallen sloppy dead"" (Neo is about to be executed, intercut with a rocket launcher being fired)

""And the White Knight is talking backwards""
(Neo punches someone hard launching them them back)

""And the Red Queen's off with her head""
(Trinity waking up in her pod intercut with her screaming so that multiple versions reverberate out of her)

""And remember what the dormouse said""
(Morpheus slams open a door, and gunshots are synced so they sound like a drum beat)

""Feed your head, Feed your head"" (quick sequence of action scenes in rapid succession while the music reaches its climax).",2

When will The Matrix 5 release 🖤,2
"В каждой своей реинкарнации я смотрю ""Матрицу"" (с). 
Кратко опишу свое видение, и почему М4 укладывается в мое понимание и откликается таким глубочайшим МЕТА переосмыслением:
-""Всё - внутри меня, внутри моей головы"";
-""Нам это не просто так снилось - это наши воспоминания"";
-""Всё было не в Матрице, а реально"";
-""Люди сами не хотят покидать Иллюзии"".

Итак, все, кто ругают новый фильм - просто не созрели, не повзрослели ещё, чтобы начать Путь к Себе - иначе критиканам была бы так понятна вся эта внутренняя тяжесть и боль измученной психики страдающего загнанного человека, у которого в ПОДСОЗНАНИИ идёт смертельная война, ведь дуальный мир - по определению предполагает конфликт и повторяющийся цикл событий. 

Я считаю, что в М4 - показана вся ""мешанина"" бесконечных ""дежа-вю"" и флешбеков нашего подсознания - и кто как воспринимает этот фильм - такое отношение имеет и к самому себе - я чувствую это как правду и честное ЗЕРКАЛО, которое многим, понятно, не нравится, но таковы все мы сейчас в едином коллективном бессознательном, где - уныние, депрессия, сеансы психотерапии, антидепрессанты, суицидальные мысли, усталость, неразбериха... Какой удивительно точный мировой ТЕСТ САМИХ СЕБЯ! ""Детям"" - не интересна работа над собой и Выход из Иллюзий, незрелые сознания хотят, чтобы им создатели выдали ""праздник"".

Нео - это наш неокортекс, который отвечает за осознанное мышление, даёт способность анализировать и оценивать свой опыт, и делает нас Человеком. Именно неокортекс способен ""перепрошивать"" более низкие уровни, придавая смысл чувствам и эмоциям, генерируемым более глубокими, подсознательными отделами мозга - это значит, надо Разумом спасти Чувства. 

Пытаясь объяснить причины и последствия своих поступков, мы высвобождаем свои чувства из подсознания, и тогда наш Разум примиряется с Чувствами (как Нео с Тринити) - а это Переход в Четвертую Меру - СЕРДЦЕ.

Символично: ""Матрица 4"" - Четвертая чакра, ""Воскрешение"" - с Сердца начинается оживление. 
А Любовь между Разумом и Чувствами - это основа всего ЕДИНСТВА, чтобы построить новый МИР (ну, только лишь для тех, кто искал Выход из бреда подсознания, - ведь после титров нам показали, кому всё ещё нравится в клетке).",2

Thank you for this. i was looking to see what people said about the story before i watch.  I just rewatched 1 - 3. The combat sequences are neat but the combat is slow and all of the attack impacts are obviously slow moving wire rigs. I never noticed as a kid because it was cutting edge back then. Now i loved the story and understood the paraboles more than ever. the combat made me feel like im watching disney choreography. Its always been the story that was important.,2

Can’t believe this trailer’s almost five years old. My hype levels were through the roof when the “Endgame” title first showed up,2
2023,2
"I still love how they kept the title of the video as Avengers to give the suspense and hype for what it would end up being called since until the reveal, it was known as Infinity War Part II",2
The MCU will NEVER reach the same heights again. It all peaked with EndGame. It’s been down-hill ever since.,2
"So this is the year when Tony dies?

Once in a lifetime to me,2
"Надо всегда говорить ПРЯМО. ВСЁ ИСКУССТВО: КИНО, ТЕАТР, МУЗЫКА, КНИГИ, ПОЭЗИЯ, имеет ИСКЛЮЧИТЕЛЬНО ДВА ГЛОБАЛЬНЫХ СМЫСЛА, либо служит ПРОСЛАВЛЕНИЮ БОЖЬЕГО СЛОВА, либо дьяволу. Служить БОЖЬЕМУ СЛОВУ это значит, каждым КАДРОМ, РЕПЛИКОЙ, КУПЛЕТОМ и т.п. ""ПРИВОДИТЬ"" НАС, ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, СЛУШАТЕЛЕЙ к ПОКАЯНИЮ, СПАСЕНИЮ ДУШИ, и соответственно наоборот, максимально удалять от него. 

МЕРЗКОЕ сатанинское КИНО. ДЬЯВОЛЬСКАЯ НАСМЕШКА, а ПОЧЕМУ надо понимать следующее. НО СНАЧАЛА. Любое НЕ УПОМИНАНИЕ(где бы то ни было) об Отце нашем небесном, подарившим для наших душ жизнь вечную, которая может испытывать такую блаженственную радость, но мы сами не хотим этого своей греховной жизнью, И также любое УПОМИНАНИЕ О БОГЕ в фильме ВСУЕ(что значит обращения к Богу без молитвы и благовейного состояния), И СЛОВА ЛЮБОВЬ, потому что Бог есть Любовь, ВСЁ ЭТО обычное мелкопакостное БОГОХУЛЬСТВО(ХУЛА на ДУХА СВЯТОГО), самый страшный грех если прельститься. НО БОГА ОБИДЕТЬ НЕ ВОЗМОЖНО ОН БЕССТРАСТЕН, А вот ХУЛА ЕГО это БОЛЬШОЙ ГРЕХ. А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ. РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ мучителей, БЕСОВ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола. Сам же ФИЛЬМ прежде всего НАМЕРЕННО «РАЗЖИГАЕТ», но В ДУШАХ самих ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, действие множества СТРАШНЫХ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, например таких как, ЛУКАВСТВО(ЗЛОСТЬ), ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ЛЮДСКОЙ СЛАВЕ), ЗАВИСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ,, МЕСТЬ, ПОХОТЬ, БЛУД, ВИНОПИТИЕ, КУРЕНИЕ, ЛЮБОСТЯЖАНИЕ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ДЕНЬГАМ), НЕМОЩЬ, И главное очень сильно НЕНАВИСТЬ. И ВОТ так, ОГРОМНОЕ БОЛЬШИНСТВО ЛЮДЕЙ(не понимают), и ВОЛЬНО ИЛИ НЕ ВОЛЬНО СОГРЕШАЮТ(не вольно значит что, грех только у себя в уме, под действием той или иной порочной страсти, является таким же грехом), И ДЬЯВОЛ «ВВОДИТ» В ДУШУ человека ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ разных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ. Ну А «ОБЩЕНИЕ» человека в жизни С любым собственным ДЕМОНОМ, «ПРИВЕДЁТ» рано или поздно только к одному, или К ПСИХИЧЕСКОМУ РАССТРОЙСТВУ, или УБИЙСТВУ, или САМОУБИЙСТВУ. И к АДУ для ДУШИ после физической СМЕРТИ тела. И что ещё имеет смысл в этом кино. Образно показано возможное дьявольское желание, и как это не странно бы звучало, дальнейшего урегулирования той напряженной военной обстановки которую мы сейчас наблюдаем в нашем мире. НО ЭТО очень «глубокий» момент, ПОНЯТЬ который МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.

Да и ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ это ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ, ЛУКАВСТВО, СЕБЯЛЮБИЕ, ТРУСОСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ЗАВИСТЬ, ЖАДНОСТЬ, ОСУЖДЕНИЕ, АЛЧНОСТЬ, СКУПОСТЬ, СРЕБРОЛЮБИЕ, ЛИЦЕМЕРИЕ, УНЫНИЕ, ЧРЕВОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, РЕВНОСТЬ, ВОРОВСТВО, РАЗДРАЖЕНИЕ, ВЛАСТОЛЮБИЕ, ПОХОТЬ, ЛЮБОПЫТСТВО, ПЬЯНСТВО, КУРЕНИЕ, ПРЕЛЮБОДЕЯНИЕ, ОБИДЧИВОСТЬ, ЗАСТЕНЧИВОСТЬ, ХИТРОСТЬ, РАССЕЯННОСТЬ и т.д. и т.п. И у КАЖДОГО ЧЕЛОВЕКА своя(СТРАСТЬ), так сказать, ЛИЧНАЯ. И ЭТО всё БОЛЕЗНИ, но БОЛЕЗНИ ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.

А ПОЧЕМУ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. После ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА и ЕВЫ они были ИЗГНАНЫ ИЗ РАЯ. ДО грехопадения они ЖИЛИ В РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и ДАЛ ЗАПОВЕДЬ «ПЛОДИТЕСЬ и РАЗМНОЖАЙТЕСЬ» и заселяйте Землю. НО для размножения, В ПОЛОВЫЕ ОТНОШЕНИЯ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ ВСТУПАТЬ БРАТУ С СЕСТРОЙ. И ЭТО было вызвано необходимостью а НЕ ПОХОТЬЮ. И ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КАЖДЫЙ рождающийся ребёнок уже ГРЕШЕН.  Только не физическое(физическое если вызвано похотью, между родными братьями и сёстрами), а так называемое ПЕРВОРОДНОЕ (ДУХОВНОЕ , ПРИЧИНА которого ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЕ) ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ(ГРЕХ, ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ) НА КАЖДОМ человеке при рождении. И У КАЖДОГО человека своя СОБСТВЕННАЯ СТРАСТЬ. И ЭТО БОЛЕЗНЬ, но БОЛЕЗНЬ прежде всего ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  И именно ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ людей являются ПРИЧИНОЙ ВСЕХ БЕД, СТРАДАНИЙ, и РАЗРУШИТЕЛЬНЫХ ДЕЙСТВИЙ на Земле. А вот условия ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЯ ОТ этого ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ, СТРАСТИ) как раз и ЗАПИСАНЫ в КНИГЕ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОМ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. НО СНАЧАЛА , чтобы донести их людям,  сам СЫН, БОГ СЛОВО ВОЧЕЛОВЕЧИЛСЯ(ИИСУС ХРИСТОС, имя ИИСУС означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ). А ЕГО за это РАСПЯЛИ. Но ОСТАЛОСЬ СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. Вот ЭТО и есть БОЖЕСТВЕННЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ , во первых ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ ОТ ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(а правильней сказать от ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ), И во вторых ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ДУШИ человеческой, ПОЛУЧЕНИЯ ЖИЗНИ ВЕЧНОЙ для ДУШИ, ПОСЛЕ физической СМЕРТИ тела , В ЦАРСТВИЕ НЕБЕСНОМ.

И поэтому ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.

Ну И ЕСЛИ каждый человек захочет ""БОРОТЬСЯ"" СО своими ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, ТО для начала, НУЖНО ПОВЕРИТЬ В БОГА, ПРЕСВЯТУЮ ТРОИЦУ: ОТЦА(СОЗДАТЕЛЯ ВСЕГО ЖИВОГО И НЕ ЖИВОГО, ВИДИМОГО мира и НЕВИДИМОГО),через СЫНА БОГА СЛОВО(ИИСУСА ХРИСТА), СВЯТОГО ДУХА. 

А ЧТОБЫ  ""ПРИЙТИ"" к БОГУ или ПОЗНАТЬ БОГА необходимо ПОКАЯНИЕ.  

Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что ЗАПИСАНО выше, И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ у каждого человека его земной жизни ОСТАЛОСЬ очень МАЛО, придёт СМЕРТЬ, И ВСЁ )СДЕЛАТЬ ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ ""шагом"" БУДЕТ (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋🏻",2

"I vividly remember working as a Security Guard in the cinema when this masterpiece was released. It was winter im the UK and the nights were getting longer. The cinema was around a 20 minute walk from my house so I would walk most days as it was convenient. The first time I saw Joker, I was genuinely petrified to walk home after work. Most of the location that the movie is filmed in resembles the route I would walk to and from work. Considering I was doing a 10 hour shift which started at 2pm till 12am it was a horrible walk home. This is from a 36 year old father of 3🤣",2

"The amount of what can only be fake comments praising this crap is unbelievable. Dude the ""plausible realism"" from the first movie is completely gone in favor of superpowers and plot armor. Freaking Marvel movies are more realistic than this movie. Armored suits have gone from not letting bullets through, to giving off sparks and going metalic on bullet impact with 0 drawbacks to the wearer. It dosnt even move when shot, yet somehow when the plot needs it to your can stab a knife through it perfectly fine, or even just a weak slice. Also if you take your eye off the main character in a scene for just a second you will see the person they currently arnt fight, just flailing around waiting for his turn to jump in.",2

МЕРЗКОЕ сатанинское КИНО. ДЬЯВОЛЬСКАЯ НАСМЕШКА, И пример МАНИПУЛЯЦИИ ДУШОЙ человека, а ПОЧЕМУ надо понимать следующее. НО СНАЧАЛА. Любое НЕ УПОМИНАНИЕ(где бы то ни было) об Отце нашем небесном, подарившим для наших душ жизнь вечную, которая может испытывать такую блаженственную радость, но мы сами не хотим этого своей греховной жизнью, И также любое УПОМИНАНИЕ О БОГЕ в фильме ВСУЕ(что значит обращения к Богу без молитвы и благовейного состояния), И СЛОВА ЛЮБОВЬ потому что Бог есть Любовь, ВСЁ ЭТО обычное БОГОХУЛЬСТВО(ХУЛА на ДУХА СВЯТОГО), самый страшный грех если прельститься. НО БОГА ОБИДЕТЬ НЕ ВОЗМОЖНО ОН БЕССТРАСТЕН, А вот ХУЛА ЕГО это БОЛЬШОЙ ГРЕХ. А ГРЕХ это РАНА которую человек наносит прежде всего сам СВОЕЙ ДУШЕ. РАНА которая ОТКРЫВАЕТ ДУШУ ДЛЯ ДЕМОНОВ мучителей, БЕСОВ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ, слуг дьявола. Сам же ФИЛЬМ прежде всего НАМЕРЕННО «РАЗЖИГАЕТ», но В ДУШАХ самих ЗРИТЕЛЕЙ, действие множества СТРАШНЫХ ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ(наши духовные болезни), ну например таких как ЛУКАВСТВО(ЗЛОСТЬ), ГОРДЫНЯ, ТЩЕСЛАВИЕ(ПАГУБНАЯ СТРАСТЬ К ЛЮДСКОЙ СЛАВЕ), ЗАВИСТЬ, ЧЕЛОВЕКОУГОДИЕ, ГНЕВ, НЕНАВИСТЬ, МЕСТЬ, ПОХОТЬ, БЛУД, НЕМОЩЬ, ВИНОПИТИЕ, КУРЕНИЕ, СТРАХ. И ВОТ так, ОГРОМНОЕ БОЛЬШИНСТВО ЛЮДЕЙ(не понимают), и ВОЛЬНО ИЛИ НЕ ВОЛЬНО СОГРЕШАЮТ(не вольно значит что, грех только у себя в уме, под действием той или иной порочной страсти, является таким же грехом), И ДЬЯВОЛ «ВВОДИТ» В ДУШУ человека ДЕМОНОВ МУЧИТЕЛЕЙ разных ПОРОЧНЫХ СТРАСТЕЙ. Ну А «ОБЩЕНИЕ» человека в жизни С любым собственным ДЕМОНОМ, «ПРИВЕДЁТ» рано или поздно только к одному, или К ПСИХИЧЕСКОМУ РАССТРОЙСТВУ, или УБИЙСТВУ, или САМОУБИЙСТВУ. И к АДУ для ДУШИ после физической СМЕРТИ тела. И ПОЧЕМУ МАНИПУЛЯЦИЯ. «ПРИОРИТЕТНЫМ» демоном который завладевает душой человека при просмотре фильма, если конечно он уже не находится в душе, а если находится тогда усиливается бесами соответствующей порочной страсти, потому что он фактически из них и состоит, БУДЕТ ДЕМОН МУЧИТЕЛЬ ЛЕНИ, ПОТОМУ ЧТО КАК реально примерно ВЫГЛЯДИТ ЭТОТ ДЕМОН, в своём «демоническом» виде, ПОКАЗАНО В этом ФИЛЬМЕ. И что касается этого демона. Это бывший основной демон мучитель лукавства(тех которых называют чертями, отпавшие от дьявола, а есть ещё и другого типа), но только этого сатана сумел поймать при попытки им завладеть душой человека одержимого другими дьявольскими демонами мучителями. И отправил его в «тюрьму»(в душу какого либо живого человека) к своему «любимцу» демону мучителю гордыни, где бывший лукавый претерпевает ужасные издевательства от него. Поэтому его состояние тяжелейшее. И если в душе живого человека он сможет стать главным(а это возможно), то не поздоровится ни самому человеку в душе которого он находится, ни всем вокруг. Вот именно так надо понимать концовку фильма. Джокер в руках дьявола. НО это всё очень «глубокие» моменты, ПОНЯТЬ которые МОЖНО будет ТОЛЬКО ЧИТАЯ, И ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧАЯ КНИГУ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ.

А ПОЧЕМУ мы ВСЕ БОЛЬНЫ. После ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЯ АДАМА и ЕВЫ они были ИЗГНАНЫ ИЗ РАЯ. ДО грехопадения они ЖИЛИ В РАЮ подобно АНГЕЛАМ. После, БОГ одел их в «одежды» что значит в тела, и ДАЛ ЗАПОВЕДЬ «ПЛОДИТЕСЬ и РАЗМНОЖАЙТЕСЬ» и заселяйте Землю. НО для размножения, В ПОЛОВЫЕ ОТНОШЕНИЯ ПРИХОДИЛОСЬ ВСТУПАТЬ БРАТУ С СЕСТРОЙ. И ЭТО было вызвано необходимостью а НЕ ПОХОТЬЮ. И ВОТ ПОЧЕМУ КАЖДЫЙ рождающийся ребёнок уже ГРЕШЕН.  Только не физическое(физическое если вызвано похотью, между родными братьями и сёстрами), а так называемое ПЕРВОРОДНОЕ (ДУХОВНОЕ , ПРИЧИНА которого ГРЕХОПАДЕНИЕ) ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЕ(ГРЕХ, ПОРОЧНАЯ СТРАСТЬ) НА КАЖДОМ человеке при рождении. И У КАЖДОГО человека своя СОБСТВЕННАЯ СТРАСТЬ. И ЭТО БОЛЕЗНЬ, но БОЛЕЗНЬ прежде всего ДУХОВНОГО ПЛАНА.  И именно ПОРОЧНЫЕ СТРАСТИ людей являются ПРИЧИНОЙ ВСЕХ БЕД, СТРАДАНИЙ, и РАЗРУШИТЕЛЬНЫХ ДЕЙСТВИЙ на Земле. А вот условия ОСВОБОЖДЕНИЯ ОТ этого ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ, СТРАСТИ) как раз и ЗАПИСАНЫ в КНИГЕ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯТОМ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. НО СНАЧАЛА , чтобы донести их людям,  сам СЫН, БОГ СЛОВО ВОЧЕЛОВЕЧИЛСЯ(ИИСУС ХРИСТОС, имя ИИСУС означает СПАСИТЕЛЬ). А ЕГО за это РАСПЯЛИ. Но ОСТАЛОСЬ СВЯТОЕ ЕВАНГЕЛИЕ. Вот ЭТО и есть БОЖЕСТВЕННЫЕ УСЛОВИЯ , во первых ИЗБАВЛЕНИЯ ОТ ПЕРВОРОДНОГО ГРЕХА(а правильней сказать от ПОВРЕЖДЕНИЯ), И во вторых ДЛЯ СПАСЕНИЯ ДУШИ человеческой, ПОЛУЧЕНИЯ ЖИЗНИ ВЕЧНОЙ для ДУШИ, ПОСЛЕ физической СМЕРТИ тела , В ЦАРСТВИЕ НЕБЕСНОМ.

И поэтому ИСТИННАЯ ВЕРА В БОГА, в первую очередь ЗАКЛЮЧАЕТСЯ В «БОРЬБЕ» каждого ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ, СО своими собственными ПОРОЧНЫМИ СТРАСТЯМИ, И только ТАК можно получить СПАСЕНИЕ для своей ДУШИ.

Ну А для того ЧТОБЫ ПОНЯТЬ ВСЁ что ЗАПИСАНО выше, И для ИСКРЕННЕГО ХРИСТИАНСКОГО ПОКАЯНИЯ, которое необходимо УСПЕТЬ(потому что ВРЕМЕНИ у каждого человека его земной жизни осталось ОЧЕНЬ МАЛО, придёт СМЕРТЬ, И ВСЁ )СДЕЛАТЬ ПРИ ЗЕМНОЙ ЖИЗНИ ЧЕЛОВЕКА, ПЕРВЫМ ""шагом"" будет (и как об этом уже упоминалось выше) ЧТЕНИЕ и ГЛАВНОЕ, ИЗУЧЕНИЕ КНИГИ ЖИЗНИ, СВЯЩЕННОГО ПИСАНИЯ НОВЫЙ ЗАВЕТ. ✋🏻",2

"포커 카드 게임과는 전혀 틀린 캐릭터! 조커! 영화속의 조커? 분명 틀린데
이게 보니깐 카드에서도 물론 게임의 종류마다 역활이 틀리게 설명 되어 있더군! 조커 라는 캐릭터?
근데 영화속의 조커는 세상의 질서를 흔드는 사회의 악으로 비쳐지거나 정신 이상자로 나오는 캐릭터인데
사실 어떻게 보면 포커에서도 히든/ 와일드 카드로서 쓰이기 때문에 우리가 흔이 아는 쎈 카드 족보를 어느 상황에서는
뒤집을수 있고 패배시킬수 있는 카드가 조커카드다. 
경주마에서도 다크호스라는 개념도 비슷한 느낌인데, 기존의 우승마에 대항할수있는 말을 바로 다크호스라고 말하는데
보통 다크호스가 우승하는 경우가 매우 적은 경우가 많다. 그러면, 조커는 포커카드게임에서 다크호스냐?

그런 개념은 아닌것 같고, 영화속에서의 조커라는 캐릭터?  조커는 악당이다? 
나는 이 물음에는 의문부호가 여러개다.  
이런 개념으로 생각해 보면, 세상의 질서속에서 사회의 근간을 흔드는 진짜 악당들 나쁜놈들이 조커보다 악질인 인간들이 많거든! 물론 영화속에서의 조커는 악당인 거지만 세상의 질서를 흔드는! 
근데 영화도 보면 조커 자신을 두고 나는 억압받고 핍박 받는 존재가 아니다 라는 말을 자주 하거든!
조커 자신은 세상의 부조리에 저항하는 투사로서  말하는 느낌을 받거든! 그러면 뭐냐? 이거지!
이 영화속에서 수 많은 조커라는 영화가 만들어졌는데 말이지!
확실히 영화 산업은 유대인들이 이끈다 라고 들은적이 있는데 말이지! 뭐! 다른 논점이긴 하지만 
난, 조커라는 영화가 나올때마다 왠지 찜찜하단 말이야! 왠지 유대인들이 이 조커라는 영화를 만들어서 말이지!
이 영화를 통해서 뭘 말하려고 하는지 이해가 않돼! 
어린아아들이 즐겨보는 권선징악의 스토리인가? 보면 그것도 아닌것 같고, 상당히 정치적인 느낌이 강하다고나 할까? 뭐 이런 느낌이 드는 영화라고 생각되는?",2

"Don't just throw around words like ""strongly anchored"", ""well-weritten"", and ""on-point character development"" when you don't even know their meaning.

This movie frnchise has a paper-thin plot, and a non-existent storyline. The whole plot is a man trying to survive after he kills those (and many, many more) responsible for killing his dog. That's it. That's the entire plot.
Nobody is watching this movie for its non-existent character development or emotional connect.

"कल मैं जवान देखने गया और आख़िरी दृश्य जब शाहरुख विजय सेतुपति के मारता हैं मैं छविगृह से बाहर निकल आया क्योंकि मैं विजय सर पिटते नहीं देख पाया।
दरअसल,मुझे लगा कि विजय सर को ये भूमिका नहीं निभानी चाहिए थीं 
अंततः: वाहवाही तो शाहरुख की हुईं और विजय सर का मुझे लगता है बस इस्तेमाल किया गया हैं।
विजय सर ,जिन्होंने 96,जल्लीकटृटु इत्यादि जैसी सुपरहिट फ़िल्में दी हैं,वो पर्दे पर पिट रहे हैं😮
यद्यपि मैं दोनों का ही एहतराम करता हूं।
आपको क्या लगता हैं विजय सेतुपति को लेकर?",2

What I concluded from part 1 is that both Amrita and Dev were a couple but Dev's ambition to become most powerful is what costed Amrita to stop him and she didn't tell him that she was pregnant. After that battle it seems Dev was somewhat sealed and needed the power of Bramhastra to be free. And maybe his followers found Amrita's Astra on that Island after the fight,2

"कुछ लोगों को ब्रह्मास्त्र मूवी बहुत अच्छी लगी अयान मुखर्जी को यह फिल्म बनाने में 12 साल लगा दिए इतनी मेहनत के बाद जो भी इन लोगों ने बनाया मुझे तो बिल्कुल भी समझ में नहीं आया मेकर्स का यहां तक कहना है की ब्रह्मास्त्र मूवी में हिंदू माइथोलॉजी को बेहतर ढंग से प्रदर्शित किया गया है परंतु सत्य इसके बिल्कुल विपरीत है सबसे पहले इसको माइथोलॉजी बोलना बेहद शर्मनाक है क्योंकि यह हमारी हिस्ट्री है कोई झूठ मुठ की परिकल्पना नहीं और हर हिंदू को इस पर गर्व भी होना चाहिए परंतु यहां बेहद दुखद स्तिथि है हम हमारे धार्मिक ग्रंथ हमारे आराध्य एवं आध्यात्मिक विषयों का उपहास देखने के लिए पैसे खर्च करके सिनेमा हॉल में तालियां पीट रहे हैं अयान मुखर्जी 12 सालों में अगर मन लगाकर 12 घंटे भी इस टॉपिक को गंभीरता से जानने की कोशिश करते तो एक बेहतर पटकथा बन सकती थी आइए जानते हैं ब्रह्मास्त्र के बारे में कुछ सामान्य बिंदु एवं सत्यता.
१  ब्रह्मास्त्र पूर्ण रूप से अभौतिक शस्त्र है अतः इसको ना तो पकड़ के घूम सकते हैं ना कहीं पर रख सकते हैं ना तोड़ा जा सकता है नाही जोड़ा जा सकता है फिल्म के अंदर ब्रह्मास्त्र के 3 टुकड़े हो रहे हैं उसको चक्र के रूप में दिखाना मानो जैसे कि वह एक पत्थर का खिलौना मात्र है जिसको इधर-उधर फेंका जा रहा है कोई जेब में रख के भाग रहा है
२ ब्रह्मास्त्र को मात्र धनुष के ऊपर आव्हान करके ब्रह्म देव की अनुमति के पश्चात ही ब्रह्मास्त्र को छोड़ा जा सकता है ब्रह्मास्त्र को नष्ट करने के लिए अथवा प्रतिउत्तर देने के लिए एक दूसरे ब्रह्मास्त्र का उपयोग करते हुए दोनों अस्त्रों को पृथ्वी के वायुमंडल के बाहर अंतरिक्ष में एक ब्रह्मास्त्र दूसरे से टकराकर परम उर्जा अत्यधिक ताप निकालते हुए दोनों अस्त्र नष्ट किए जा सकते हैं हमारी मूवी के अंदर महान कलाकार आलिया भट्ट जिनके हिसाब से भारत का प्रधानमंत्री पृथ्वीराज चौहान है इनके प्रेम की शक्ति के सामने ब्रह्मास्त्र भी हार जाता है
३ ब्रह्मास्त्र केवल वही धारण कर सकता है जो एक सच्चा साधक हो जिसने रूद्र साधना करके भगवान शिव को प्रसन्न किया हो तत्पश्चात शरीर की सभी इंद्रियां साधक के पूर्ण वश में हो पूर्ण रूप से कुंडलिनी अनुष्ठान मैं सफल होने के पश्चात ब्रह्मदेव की कठोर साधना के बाद ही कोई ब्रह्मास्त्र को धारण कर सकता है वह भी किसी श्रेष्ठ गुरु के आशीर्वाद एवं सानिध्य मैं रह कर। श्री राम ने भी सभी अनुष्ठान यज्ञ करने के पश्चात ही ब्रह्मास्त्र को धारण किया था
४ ब्रह्मास्त्र का उपयोग किसी एक शत्रु अथवा किसी सीमित क्षेत्रफल को नष्ट करने के लिए नहीं बनाया गया था ब्रह्मास्त्र को दो प्रमुख कारणों के लिए बनाया गया था प्रथम युग परिवर्तन के समय दूसरा कारण ब्रह्मांड के किसी बहुत बड़े पिंड को खंड करते हुए नष्ट करने के लिए",2

"The traditional Sakura (the most simple version) uses 13 notes because the instrument (the koto) has that many strings ignoring the base version (17) strings or any other custom made variants. Usually it is turned to the Hira scale (Hira-joshi) which is the following;
D G A A# D D# G A A# D G A
I think this version uses at least 2 kotos though, both in the same scale. If not, probably Gaku instead (replace all A# with C, D# with E). One person is definitely pressing on the strings, which depending on how hard can make it either sharp or one note higher.
- a koto player",2
This sounds like a soundtrack from Ghost of tsushima,2

"Traditional Japanese court music was directly influenced by the music of ancient Central Asia via the Silk Road. Central Asian music spread to the court of Tang Dynasty China during the Middle Ages and from there spread to Japan. Therefore one can hear a slight similarity between Japanese traditional music and that of Central Asian cultures such as Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and the Uyghurs.",2

Pathaan 2 when????,2
"I think the actual joke here is that the characters are getting far too much amusement out of something that's both lame and insensitive. That's overwhelmingly the pattern throughout the show - e.g. George pathetically failing to make an interviewer laugh with a random Mexican accent, Kramer's accidental blackface, Peterman acting like Allan Quatermain's embarrassing uncle, etc. - wherever it appears the insensitive stuff is not the punchline, the characters make themselves the punchline by being (or sometimes accidentally appearing) insensitive. People might still laugh at it for the wrong reasons, but I definitely don't think that was the writers' aim.",2

Sakuras, sakuras...
Nas montanhas, campos e nas vilas.
Tão longe quanto o olho pode ver...
Serão isto a neblina ou as nuvens?
Resplandecente em todo o Sol Nascente.

Sakuras, sakuras.
Todas florescidas!


Sakuras já desbrocharam,
vou para casa após ver as flores.
Yosino me lembra das sakuras.
Tatuta é como o outono.
Karasaki e suas mudas de pinheiro.

Perene, perene.
Em todos os tons de verde!


Sakuras, sakuras.
Vasta por todo o ceu estrelado!
Tão longe quanto o olho pode ver.
Serão isto a neblina ou as nuvens?
Fragrante por todo o ar...

Vamos lá, vamos lá...
Vamos sair e vê-las!",2

She was saying all kinds of things about how she'd like to take their Jewelry & their Cadillac or something. All kinds of stuff. Anybody know what season & episode this is/was?,3

I watched this movie and I must say it's an alright movie. Joker is like a crazy guy to everyone cause of his laughing condition. In the end was chaotic. He ended up taking the city.,3
I am really curious how the man of practical effects has recreated a nuclear explosion.,3
So true,3
True. Now Aquaman needs new cast.,3
I can’t tell who did it better; heath ledger or Joaquin phoenix,3
​ @tpn922 Agree.,3
"""Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped turned upside down 
I'd like to take a minute just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became Prince of a town called Bel-Air""


That opening line immediately brought me to watching that show.",3
I am here in 4-10-2022. If anybody here right now like below.,3
"Will Smith was overdoing the acting, and the comedy didn't feel like it was coming naturally, it was over the top and excessive, it's like he was trying so hard to be funny on fresh prince of bel air, I enjoyed the other cast members, but I'm sorry I wasn't feeling Will.",3
2019 best damn year for movies,3
"""The pitch for the show, the real pitch, when Larry and I went to NBC in 1988, was we want to show how a comedian gets his material. The show about nothing was just a joke in an episode many years later, and Larry and I to this day are surprised that it caught on as a way that people describe the show, because to us it's the opposite of that.""",3
this song is so good even my 2nd grade pe class dances to it (now 3rd grade but its ok),3
"It was rather desturbing for me, it was very good.",3
Joker and Batman is like yin and yang. They both equal,3
Cool enough,3
"Batman? More like Batboy. Even Catwoman said it, ""Batboy"". If this was meant to be a tribute to Fast and Shitious, should have named it Batboy, Fast and Hedious,",3
"Proper if not “Fresh” version of the story:
I born and raised in Western Philadelphia, I spent most of my years growing up playing basketball with others, one time aggressive people beat me up, my mother packed up my clothes and sent me on my way to Bel Air, where I’d attend Bel Air’s academy school",3

Amazing ❤❤❤",3
What a roll he played as Vikram rathore,3
"I’ll tell you something factual about this movie. Christopher Nolan had two of the old soldier witnesses watch a premier of his movie and the reaction was beyond what Nolan had expected. It was noted that on the scene when Oppenheimer was going to initiate the first explosion that the scene made the 2 old men get up and leave the cinema because they literally couldn’t handle what Oppenheimer had said. If I’m right, before the initiation of the blast it was the first time in the history of man kind that I shit you not Oppenheimer said “It’s Morbin time”. 

Truly a movie of all time.",3
"I searched for "" stereotypical Japanese guitar"" and glad i found this",3
"Been to almost every nolan film first day in theatres since the dark Knight, even during pandemic I managed to go for tenet first day! Nolan is just an incredible inspiration.whether with his dream reality inception or his space epic interstellar!❤️

Yes you are only one,3
"I liked the scene where Miguel O'Hara tells Dom : ""You have a choice between saving one family or every family in the family-verse..."". Really building up the goosebumps :v",3
No I am too appreciating VFX of this movie 100000000000 times better than ADIPURUSH.,3
It's also for those who loves the Need for speed franchise,3
Good for you? Unoriginal hack.,3

Same here one of my favorite movies ever,3
 @rain8183 lol,3
Yea cool huh,3
 @LouTerry-xc2cc  Maybe not the best but it's definitely worth it,3
Was This Movie That Good I Never Seen It,3
This was surprisingly a really long trailer,3
This is what inspired the inazuma main theme/ raiden shougun/ Ei’s theme,3
Srk please next movie update please🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏,3
man this is still so good,3
Well that must be infinity mf drive,3
"What you said just makes no sense whatsoever. You are the only person I've ever seen say this. You gotta be trolling. It is AMAZING that Nolan used no CGI for this film. He is going to make the Nuke in this movie utterly terrifying. And practical effects can be WAY BETTER to use if you know how to do it right. Nolan is trying something new here. 12k resolution, 70mm, made for IMAX. I encourage filmmakers to use more practical than CGI. Yes CGI is amazing nowadays. But the reason why Nolan  is incredible is specifically because he uses as less CGI as possible. His set pieces are incredible. How are you going to complain about that? I will always choose practical over CGI. Always.",3
I'm here back again to feel proud of Ayan Mukerji,3
 @AntonQvarfordt  Since when did using just practical effects become such a bad thing? It's perfect. How dare you disrespect Nolan. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Practical effects make movies better. Nolan has proved that.,3
"Jokers are not laughing stock, they make everyone laugh, they live in people's hearts",3
Very good 👍 😢,3
I'm here after the joker 2 valentine day look of joker and harley.,3
Thanks for explaining the plot 👌,3
" @justinbeard2024  Well worth having it, it's crazy good.",3
"​ @PopsiCOLE  They are both good when used at the right time and in the right way... CGI/practical...
But insisting on one or the other to me just shows close mindedness that's ultimately detrimental.. And IMO just not a very clever way to go about things.

Just closing off a whole field of effects work out of hand just by virtue of the method which they are produced...
To me that just makes no sense whatsoever.",3
Can't stop coming back to this... ❤️,3

Very comfortable music,3
Dawmmm they played Notorious BIG Ft Bone Thung N Harmony in the background I feel old AF😂😂😢,3
"Guys chill. The clips from the trailer all come from the pilot. Producers often have to feel their way around the first few episodes to figure out what works.

This is one of only a few shows that gets better with each episode. And what a ride it has been! Nine Nine!",3

"Nothing new to add since Dune 1, except that the plot and next scenes became more interesting. Except for the overlords in black. Every one of their scenes was a time drain. I wanted only to see more of the desert people, in the desert. Loved the ending. Great choice how it was so unsatisfying as the lead transformed, or returned. One or the other. 
I read somewhere that this book was the originator of Star Wars. I never got through one of those, they were likewise drawn out to the breaking point, but also silly. I see we have the 'Luke I am your father' moment, the exile in the barren desert culture, yet space travel. Yoda, albeit a muppet, was more developed than Dune the movie's mysticism. But I do love Dune's worms, seer poisons, and the mother witch.",3

 @tvshowmemes-jt8eb  bro I am not forcing you to like the movie,3
Yes I amm,3
Congratulations for 100m views,3
the craziest bit about this film is me realizing just now that it's not even part of the dark knight OR suicide squad but that it's actually in fact a political satire. that's...some pretty genius thought back in 2017 during the writing process.,3
I watched this trailer before starting brooklyn 99 now im on season 5 and i swear its sooo weird and different but i like it,3
They won't fear it until they understand it And they won't understand it until they've used it Theory will take you only so far.,3

"I woke up on the first day of Spring in Narita. The day before the trees had been bare. In the morning as I walked I saw the first of the Sakura blossoms and when I came to the park, all of the Sakura trees where in bloom. This song was playing in my head. I caught a flight that afternoon and crossed the International Date Line before the day had ended and flew into the beginning of Spring in the Western Hemisphere. By the time midnight came in Los Angeles, it had been 40 hours for me since the Dawn of Spring, at the beginning of which I saw the first bloom of the Sakura.",3
 @TheKnight886  yes sir! I think james Gunn is going to revive DC in a way people have never seen before. So excited. If I was marvel I’d be scared lmao. That sounds corny but this is PEAK DC and no one’s really talking about it,3

" @norm-bb3bb  i also trusted WB, Todd Philips & Scott Silver, they ended up breaking hearts",3
Yeah,3
" @norm-bb3bb  honestly that movie wasn't dependent for a sequel because the 1st one crossing 1 Billion was enough, that hype was absolutely insane. The movie goers were flooded to see Joker 2019, the second movie didn't have the half of the hype that Part 1 had. On the opening day the film was only 50 to 55% occupied and plus what they did with Joker 2 i wish there was no sequel. I was the only who was hyped up for the sequel till i saw the movie",3
I haven't seen Joker 2 cuz I wait for the good one to come up,3
they're going to play flash,3

"Something that won't happen, but should, would be a return to movie theaters of AVENGERS INFINITY WAR and ENDGAME as a special double feature for Christmas of 2024. Maybe a two-week run. People who never got to see these movies in a real theater would line up in droves! Even if they already know every moment and every line from both movies. It would be so much fun to hear ""Avengers assemble"" in a movie theater one more time, even though I've watched my Blu-Rays over and over.",3
I still think this is better than the Dark Knight Trilogy,3
how to download full movie any one help me .....please,3
excellent movie one of the greats,3

"Well I was born and raised in Scranton, PA
Lifeguard by the swimming pool is where I spent my days
Till a guy named Corn Pop, who wasn’t that cool
Started making trouble at the swimming pool
So I took a chain, and wrapped it around my legs
They’re harrier than my other legs
No—n—not my other legs…
Black kids would touch ‘em!
Cmon man!
Then I got on a train, and moved to DC
Jerbrak Jabroma gave a job to me!
I shuffled around, and bit fingertips
Gave a big speech, kissed a boy on the lips!
I hold the ladies tight, and sniff all their hairs.

Comment ko duble tap kro like hota hai,3
"Early 1940s FBI went after ""Astounding"" editor Campbel and Kirby of ""Marvel Comics"" for mentioning nuclear while such publications had ads for cyclotronists so still officials have censored some unanswered questions about contradictions of officially what happened on Aug 6, 1945 and Aug 9, 1945..

Could it have tapped interdimensional portals between parallel universes and if so may be David Hartcher Childress could write a vintage 1960s Shaggy God story where flying saucers are squat type bedpan chamber pots with forward labia rests and rear foot riser rest engine nacelles?",3
Left fresh prints on Chris Rock,3
Came here to praise the VFX of Bramhastra after watching Aadipurush teaser 😭,3

frr 2023 still listing to it lol,3
" @PopsiCOLE  I'm really complaining about the mindset more than the movies (I love most of em)... I don't like that mindset... Him and Quentin.
I'm not saying their movies would be better with CGI in them (well, maybe Dunkirk a little). But I just really have a problem with that type of conservative mindset... Especially when it goes under the guise of sophistication.
There's this whole ""We keep it real!"" sort of chauvinistic mindset or air associated with it.

None of it's real - now matter how you choose to do you special effects.",3
Movies havent changed since 2018 and 2024 honestly.,3
This show is like the scrubs for the police department...brilliant and funny..,3
That where history was created ❤,3

Then I watched the movie... smh. One of the biggest disappointments of my life (Last Jedi is still the biggest lol). I don't think the movie on paper is bad. I like how and where they took it.  But good lord is the execution horrible. A real slap in the face to fans smh",3

"I think we all can agree we keep coming back to the cinematographic experience that this trailer is.
Because, somewhere deep down in our hearts, we can still imagine the movie this could have been.
The movie we deserved. The movie about the memories that they took from us to turn into a videogame.

We keep coming back to this trailer as in a neverending loop.",3
The trailer is better than the movie! It was expected more!,3
"Ok im gonna trust you on this one, gonna atch the first episode tight now just for this comment.. if I dont like im coming back to you",3

 @st6645  The show is amazing I don't get how you can't find it funny. And the people who produced it are Jewish so there is more diversity.,3
I'm just sad that it might take another 27 years for Chris and Will to be resolved. Janet remained dignified throughout.   Was any lesson learnt Will?,3
True,3
When the movie trailer is a 100 times better than the actual movie...😢,3
"Biggest plot armor movie of all plot armor movie combine. With so many unbelievable plot armor in this movie, I am willing to believe Santa Clause is more realistic than this movie surviving danger.

Still give me this energy Vibes,3
the last good movie was F8 in 2017,3
you can tell every scene was reviewed and picked for the music. Every gesture and detail was to motivate a crescendo of thought to reality of vision. Which trailers now have a standard to live up too and not out do.,3
"#poems 👉It will blow cold
In great depth
And there is no escape
To those souls who are in illusion
Wandering until now,
Looking for yourself in vain
And spending time often
The game will let go only then,
When you're in life
You'll lose something
And turn off consciousness
From the strong networks of sleep
You will see the truth
Or maybe you'll lose it again

Can anyone explain the joke with the throne that rotates on the floor in beginning?,3

"No, it doesn't. 3 could be, easily. But this was a good movie.",3
Yo the short version comes on 90% very rare the full play on tv. Very rare,3
It's actually very entertaining if you aren't expecting the first movie again. People like to hate things and complain. It's what people who think they're the cool kids do.,3
Waiting for Tiger 3 Blockbuster ❤️🇮🇳🇮🇳🇮🇳,3
@DylanCass-zn2xx  yeah,3
Inspired by Boruto,3
"Rest in peace, Quincy Jones!",3

LMAO. You never saw the original aye?,3
"Wasn't interested in watching the movie, but after watching this trailer.....man Im convinced that I was right",3
It's been 3 years since this came out and I can't wait for the sequel. The Penguin was a great series setting up the next film which hopefully will be out before 2030😂 but this is EXACTLY how a DC film should be made not the kiddie bs stuff make it gritty and edgy.,3
One of my fav. The vengeance,3
"This was very informative, appreciate it.",3

"This film was amazing, if you disagree you just didn't get it",3
I really enjoyed the movie.,3
🙄🙄🙄. One off the films that you waited for.. And the trailer is better than the movie..,3
"This film was unnecessary — Lana should have stopped at the third instalment since it was the end for obvious reasons.

This fourth instalment I felt the creators and producers were trying to throw objects at a wall and see if they would stick, and of course it did not.

It was a waste for the company to try and pitch ideas and revive a long-gone franchise.",3
A three minute trailer? Thank you for revealing the film.,3
I think that the Ventriloquist would be an interesting choice,3
"You can Watch it bro, It probably have some shows available in most cities
Theatre experience was like, I'm in a Concert 😌",3
I feel like I have seen the entire movie....and the trailer isn't even over yet,3

I wish Dante wasn’t so Joker-esque. He was way too much like the joker type villain,3
Tiger3 trailer ke aas pass bhi nhi hain thakaan ka trailer😂😂,3
There's a reason why only one of the (former) brothers created it instead of them both collaborating,3
He acted like John wick not neo.,3

I've experienced a similar thing with a music visualiser video having its entire audio track quietly replaced... The funny thing is that nobody even comments on it...,3
"As the credentials at the end of the trailer indicate, this is merely based on the concept of the original The Matrix trilogy...",3
​ @mrdawood867 well see box office too if salaar could cross jawan collection then we will talk,3
Viva was one of the BEST TV channels :(,3

Loved it.,3
"I love the part when Dom raced Aquaman on the highway and said, 'You may have waves, but I’ve got family.'",3
"Did they change the trailer like a glitch in the matrix? I don't remember the therapist snapping his fingers :15. I remember Morpheus's door being completely upside down not just at a 45 degree angle at 2:10, amongst other things. Do they have the power to re-upload a different edit without people knowing?",3
Loved this movie 😍🎥🎉🎉,3
This movie needs to be deleted from the original cannon. Enough said.,3
"Pehla muja Srk pasand nhi tha 😂
Phir mana jawan movie dekhii ..now I'm a big fan of sharukh khan ❤❤❤ ..now I'm waiting for dunki first day first show ❤❤❤",3

I remember the day this trailer dropped. Was waiting in the car for a friend to finish a recording session and my cousin got a notification to the upload. We thought it was gonna be another fake trailer but by time my friend got back we had watched it about 4 times and where beyond giddy. I would do almost anything to be able to watch this trailer for the first time again 🥹,3
Far better than Tiger3 trailer,3
The only thing good about this trash of a movie,3
thos movie looks good cant wait,3
 @Mr.S369  i don't want no one to like it. I still think your comment was strange.,3

Ok,3
Daddy caddy’s version is better,3
"Ahh man. This woke generation can't stop killing my childhood's legends. Look at Terminator Fart Fate - u managed till the middle than left the cinema. A robot who watch football and drinks light beer? Or movie about how the powers that be control us-and you can't find 2 minutes getaway of sound soundtrack, a ONE SINGLE line that'd define the word Resurrections... Ah man. My daughters has Down syndrome. She's almost eight. Her words:""Daddy, why this machine nearly kissed Neo?"" yep, my daughter now thinks it's okay if a freak show ain't a freak show but a Saturday circus in Minnesota",3
Most I have ever been disappointed in a movie. The whole thing is kind of a buildup to the next film. Its like a 2hr trailer for a film thats not made yet. Heres hoping the 5th film delivers!,3

I like this film I watched him now 😂,3

The push and pull of the trailer, rhythmically, is just amazing. By the time Trinity screams, I’m in tears. Every time...",3

Wow,3
Awesome trailer. One of the best ever. Too bad they apparently didn't care about the movie itself,3

 @diabdia  lol the should have made it without her 😂 🤣 😅 😆,3
It's only a movie relax 🤣🤣,3
"I just watched it again with no sound. Only for the visuals. I can't comprehend how Nolan visualises all those. Contrary to the norm, his creativity is increasing with time and age. 

For any of his last films, when we just think this is the best film ever, he drops another better one and we have no option but to change our opinion. With each film he makes, he is breaking his own record.",3
Yep it’s 😂,3

 @diabdia  The movie would have been better with warner getting someone else to make it.,3
I feel bad for Lana. Warner bros were going to make it without her so she made it so she had some autonomy. She tried her best and I appreciate it,3
Always a joke,3
Destruction never looked this beautiful!!,3
Love the trailer. Can watch it on a loop. Despite the reviews I loved the movie.,3

"When I saw this trailer for the first time it felt really familiar, and now I know why, the song, I heard it before, it plays during the last mission of Call of Duty Black Ops 3. Surreal",3
"Yeah I’m halfway through and I’m bored, Robert has no charisma , Zoe looks like a transformer with that line backers jaw and huge brow bone! None seen to have any sparks when acting together it’s a huge disappointment tbh. I’ve come to see if it’s worth watching or just cut n run now. All these rave reviews must be bot comments surely",3

this will be good,3
"Finally got around to watching the film and I don't care if you hate me for saying this, but I think that this is the best version of Batman that I have seen. This didn't even feel like it was three hours long. Can't wait to binge watch The Penguin next",3
Super hit movie,3

Good,3
I liked the film and how I think it was consistent with the trailer.,3
calm down you gotta wait at least 2 if not 3 years for the sequel,3
The teaser was enough for me. Too much going on looking back at this trailer lol,3
"Back when we liked Will Smith, before that slap, before we knew he was a simp",3
yes Philadelphia,3
"same here, i can still feel that wonder almost like it was in 1999 again...almost feel that emotion on seeing the trailer for the matrix for the first time.",3

I wish I would've never watched the movie and just lived with this trailer for hype eternally,3

Amazing the Carl Jhonson 💪,3
Last seen very funny 😂😂,3
"There was hardly a story in Pathan , a story less movie with marketing tricks. Now here again hardly a single line in trailer which attracts towards a strong story . Again cheap punch lines and i am guessing a Jorwan scene (twins, double roll) . Sharukh cant afford a Ganja Skinhead Character. It must be a bad twin .",3
What a let down of a movie. It lacked depth i felt like i was watching a spoof,3
Back in the 90's Will Smith voice kinda sounds like Chris Rock a lil bit,3
If only the movie was as good as the trailer,3

oxford pictionary really? ! Sounds like something I read about someone that wrote a book & titled it Shit because they were told they couldn't & proved everyone wrong. I used to know a guy that's address was 8 Uranus Drive. Said it always got him in trouble in school until principal found out he was telling the truth. I remember not believing him & finding it in phone book!,3
"happymemories Apparently Eugene Levy searched a phone book to find out if Schitt was an actual last name. Then he took that to the network and showed them, so they agreed to air the name.",3

 I'm a big fan of his right back to his work on the David Letterman show of the 1980s. He was on Dave's show a few nights ago to say a farewell to Letterman who will be retiring soon. I thought that Chris looked unhealthy and underweight. However one of the first things that Letterman said upon seeing him was how great he looked. Maybe to make him feel better (that is if he is in fact seriously ill. )",3

"It’s not consistent with the other matrix movies, but I keep watching Matrix 4. I’m 40 years old so I was in my teens when I saw the first matrix and it made me want to be a film maker. Guess what? I never became one. I draw online manga and I drew artistic inspiration from Akira Toriyama and Calvin and Hobbes. I was too poor to go to art school so I stick with inks. I draw my ideas in a raw matter. No focus groups. The Matrix gave me optimism but I’m 40 and the job and bills are holding me down. I really do feel like I fell in a prison. And The Matrix 4 did away with the glamour. What does an old Thomas Anderson look like in a system that is design to keep him prisoner? I think we got it. It’s actually a sad movie for me.",3

"Joaquin Phoenix called perfecting the Joker's laugh the toughest part of playing the character.

Joaquin Phoenix named Tim Curry's performance in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) as one of his inspirations for his performance in this film.

The second DC movie featuring the Joker to be R-rated after Batman: The Killing Joke (2016).

The film is Joaquin Phoenix's fourth Oscar nomination for acting (and his first-ever win).

The first film based on a comic book to win the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.

This film is the first theatrical live-action Batman spin-off since Suicide Squad (2016).
Sharon Washington's character is named Debra Kane as a tribute to Batman's co-creator Bob Kane.

The film was the second R-rated comic book film released in 2019. The first 2019 comic book film released is Hellboy (2019).

The first R-rated movie in history to make $1 billion worldwide.

Costing $55 million, this is the least expensive film to gross over $1 billion.",3

"I knew before I clicked on the trailer the first shot would be of the bomb exploding.   My other comment - they succeeded with make-up in making Cillian into either a very strange looking human, or alien.  Exaggerated baby blues and facial bone structure.  Not much like the real J. Robert. but certainly other-worldly like him.  I will see it in a cinema.",3
@ i hope you’re right i think that should be his song,3

Yep,3
I’d say yeah,3
"I've always seen Seinfeld as the benchmark of situational comedy.  It's core root is everyday situations any of us could get into, and how funny they are, but when you look at them objectively or try to explain to others, than can seem mundane. It's the opposite of generic sitcoms where ridiculous things happen to generic people, most stuff that many of us would never experience in our lifetime.  In Seinfeld, the stuff that takes place happens with everyone, just like most of these things happened to Larry David.",3
Oh my god I can't wait to see this damn 🔥 This is going to be the best movie of the year,3
Way way way better than I expected,3
Ok,3
"Theirs a sequel, get over it, the movie did well.",3

He is a fresh king of bel air.,3
 @eggegg9026  You wrote that novel for nothing. George isn’t pitching this because he realizes he’s actually in a show. It’s “Meta“ because the show we’re watching involves characters that are pitching an idea that’s exactly like the show we’re watching. It’s that simple,3

Bob Pickleson that’s not breaking the fourth wall. It’s meta humor. Breaking the fourth wall is when a character acknowledges the audience.,3
yannick245 they did lmao they said they were all characters on a show about nothing that is meta which is 4th walk breaking,3

 Archishman Rath  Not rly in my opinion. Todd Phillips is a bad director and his previous work are pretty mediocre. The acting and the score is the only thing carrying the film. Todd Phillips treats his audience like a bunch neanderthals and he spoonfed the plot.,3

Exodus 34:19 All that openeth the matrix [is] mine; and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, [that is male.
Numbers 3:12 And I, behold, I have taken the Levitesfrom among the children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the
children of Israel: therefore the Levites shall be mine;
Numbers 18:15 Everything that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they bring unto the LORD, [whether it be] of men or beasts, shall be thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.",3

"Not that into the whole John Wick thing, however, this was action packed, as they all are I'm told, and well written except one totally unbelievable scene when he leaps from the window and lands on the VW bus below. He would have died upon impact from breaking his back and neck. That was not something any human would get up and walk away from. My favorite scene was when he shot the guy (just before leaping out the window) for almost shooting the dog. I still need to watch the other chapters from beginning to end to get the full affect of John Wick. 
Keanu said he was tired after doing these films and needed to end them. He's such an amazing actor.❤❤❤",3

The UK 🇬🇧 owes big time to everyone they ruled upon and oppressed for centuries, the US , and canda should learn from them and follow the same cuz they're white. What Germany did during WW2 they owe the humanity big time and should open gates for evryone to take a refuge . The Nuremberg trials which brought ⚖️ so nany N@zzi to the court of justice , the german state apologized to evryone for thr actions of 
H!tler But.......but  nobody absolutely no freakin body says the same thing about Japan 🇯🇵 when they commited some serious acts of h0rrors during the WW2. Again!!  everyone remembers what The US did in Hiroshima and Nagasaki but no-one talks about 30million people' who got UnAlived 💀💀by The Japanese. Evryone goes numb , dumb and blind on that 🙈🙊🙉 as if it was all one sided by the USA the western people and western powers are full of corrupt, sick , individuals!! But Japan oh no Japan is the land of perfection sunshine 🌺 and rainbows 🌈. Toxic Double standards are at par with this one . What about Japan they didnt even apologized? What about trials against the Japanese for their actions, the acts of horrors and heinous crimes committed by them. Evryone talks about the Nuremberg trials, what's about the Japanese Monarchy and top brass did they were dragged to ⚖️courts of justice for thier actions !? .",3

"The purpose of a sequel/prequel is mainly to provide a tighter and cleaner story. In other words, it continues a story begun in another. Despite Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2 has a good story, there is no such part which links it to the first, which is quite annoying. Nowadays instead of having good stories, movies are all bits and pieces of all other movies which make them cliche in the end, like you'd know what would happen. The movie was good, but became way too commercial when all the special effects were added, which eventually did not make it any different from other Bollywood scary movies.",3
"the VOLUME!!!!!!
i had problems hearing / comprehending the actors as that background noise was so over the top. had to block my ears several times for minutes so as i would be able to hear later

"The Hirajoshi scale has some similarities to many Chinese scales, often mistaken as pentatonic to western ears although Chinese music theory is far more complex and layered than just the pentatonic and most scales have more than five note. The Hirajoshi starts with a half step which has a similar feeling the the last two notes of the harmonic minor scale (despite opposite points in the scale) which itself has been used as a scale that somewhat imitates middle eastern music which is why you think it's between Chinese and Egyptian.

Although the Hirajoshi is an incredibly unique scale with different regional tunings just like most music of East Asia.",3

"He is a trained male version of a Bene Gesserit. They are a order of women so I am fine with how his character is portrayed. I think she is pretty, but her face doesn't fit that world. She looks like a catwalk model who gets regular deliveries of Dove and Oil of Olay.",3

I miss these years of Marvel movies. Not the crap they're putting put now,3
" @juwe7143  a good movie will keep me in suspense, or made me wait for some answers to the questions raised at the beginning of the movie. Or at least they will ask some questions at the beginning of the movie. No sense, no fun, no questions in the first (as you said) sixth of the movie, without any sign that even one question will be set in the next 20 minutes. I saw a pair of tities. Again, without any context (they meet, they are having sex, tities are there, then she get up from him, browsing trough the books asking nonsense philosophical questions). When there is nothing at the beginning of the film, then you have no need or desire to waste time any further. For me, the movie is a failure. Or to watch it and rewind to interesting parts. Or even better, you review the film, cut it and edit it into a meaningful and exciting story.",3
Congratulations King khan Fans pathaan trailer 100+ million views completes 💪💪💪💪💪💪,3

"Feyd looking completely inhuman is a very strange choice. The baron looks weird because diseases inflicted on him when he raped a Bene Gesserit like an idiot, she specifically selected nonlethal body revolting stuff because the baron was wildly proud of his body, which is partly why he's so obsessed with Feyd, vicarious life. Feyd is supposed to be charming attractive and seemingly kind. The entire point of the bait and switch with Rabban. He's the good cop to Rabban's bad. Making him look like an escapee from Dark City is a (bald) head scratcher. This should have all been a GOT funded level TV show. Or animated to prevent actors from holding production hostage or ruining it.",3

And FYI, TGM had a 6 month run in theaters and was 1 of the biggest movies in the post Covid era that ACTUALLY did bring many older audiences BACK INTO THEATERS. I thought all this is basic common sense stuff and public knowledge, not my fault if you can't even understand that and are so offended over God only knows what!",3

"After five years still the best movie of rhe modern era . How can a comic book movie become a cinematic masterpiece of a film 

Every film after has failed in comparison because this was to early for its time , no one can not even compete with a trailer after half a decade never mind a film DC still teying to play catch up, whast nwxt another batman and another superman ? They already did that , yawn boring ......next please 

WB pack it in please you've had your turn in the 80s and 90s , if marvel was around then you would of failed again...

I think marvel stabbed themselves in the foot , the characters and the product just cannot be competed with not even by themselves..maybe this was the starting point of the end of cinema, this coming from a film director and someome who went through the star wars / bact to the future and inidian jones era .....

This film was something else",3

Always will hit. Hits harder the more I watch it honestly,3
"The movie is 6/10 and unnecessarily long. I regret going into the theater to watch it, should have just waited for it to come out on streaming services. Unlike Inception, the movie is based on a pretty straightforward plot and storyline, but Nolan had to make it more convoluted than it needed to be. I feel the movie could easily be trimmed to 2 hours and still deliver the same effects/results. 
The number of characters in the movie are also unnecessarily huge and hard to remember. Nolan failed to demonstrate the importance of many characters in my opinion. They are just there. 
There are also a lot of the scenes not really tied together. For example, in the first 10 mins of the movie, it keeps showing Oppenheimer throwing glasses into the coroner and seeing molecules movement, Nolan didn’t really built those scenes into anything significant. I assume those are just used to show Oppenheimer’s intelligence, but the whole scenes feel chaotic and messy.",3

"He is fascinated my middle eastern themes, as shown in his movie Incendies 2010 and Dune. As someone who has traveled to the ME. The setting, the garb, the use of Arabic and Muslim religious constructs throughout the film are groundbreaking. The resemblance of the Fremen people to the Bedouins is uncanny. The allusions to the Middle East are unmistakable, especially as the novel came on the heels of the oil boom in the Gulf states. Frank Herbert’s editors initially asked him to tone down the “Muslim flavor” of his book. Trying to avoid Herbert’s apparent insensitivity, the filmmakers actively subdued most elements of Islam, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The new movie treats religion, ecology, capitalism and colonialism as broad abstractions, stripped of particularity.",3
@ ooooooohhhhhhhhh I see thank you,3
If this one is received well they will inevitably make more dune films,3
Still with avengers infinity war the best marvel movie (in my opinion),3

The scene from above resembles grains of sand with Paul sifting through them and being separate because he is the Kwisatz Haderach that the Bene Gesserit have been working towards all those years.",3

But against Islam, it is more obvious: the names, the sand, the desert, the PROPHET...all lead to my conclusion. I'm very curious how would those fundamentalists (the real ones) would agree or not to this movie...I wouldn't be surprised to see some Muslim countries forbidding this movie.",3

"Theorethically you could, but i don't reccomend it. You'd loose on important world building and the pay-off wouldn't be as great. I'd reccomend watching the first movie beforehand or AT LEAST watch some recap on youtube. That being said, part two is an amazing movie in it's own right and if you decide to see it, you will want to watch part one as well.",3

"An original DC story about a good person slowly transforming into the evil Joker over time, eventually becoming Batman’s nemesis. In many stories, the Joker is older than Batman. A clear example is the Joker’s wrinkles and his posture in The Dark Knight (2008), which resemble the stance of a man in his 40s. If we assume Bruce is 9 in the movie and the Joker is 33, Bruce would become Batman at 23, while the Joker would be the known villain in his mid-40s 🃏.",3
I find it saddening that so many comments are praising the actor and not the story. Both are great. But you might be missing the forest through the trees. I just hope Feynman makes a poignant point somewhere in here. Even if it's just on the bongos.,3

I know what I am getting into.  I  expect well constructed scenes that go somewhere.  Watching Oppenheimer was about as stimulating as watching a 3 hour senate hearing.  The music was also awful.  @MATDMixes ,3
Agreed wholeheartedly,3

This trailer is better than the movie,3
2025 wale like kre🎉,3
Super movie,3
" @Ieokk yeah, I agree with you. Sure you could see it as a war crime. But the Japanese would never give up. We just kept sending men over there to die. The two bombs ENDED the war. It saved thousands of American soldiers, and maybe even some Japanese. If we didn’t drop the bomb there would have been a full scale invasion of Japan and that wouldn’t have ended well. Plus, the movie focuses on Oppenheimer and the guilt he felt for making the bomb. So stop trying to cause an argument and go watch the film.",3
I hope they make joker 3,3
Amazing movie ❤️❤️❤️ Bollywood me bahut time baad itni acchi movie dekhne ko mila ❤️❤️❤️ i m waiting for 2nd part 😍,3
"honestly I think it might be one of the( if not THE) best trailer for anything, genuinely I barely cared about the movie, but the first one and then this made me hyped like nothing for some time before, stellar trailer",3
He’s not weak after he became joker.,3
Wish that 5y turned into 5 days so I could watch endgame for the first time again🤧,3
God This Trailer Already Feels Nostalgic 😢,3
I really like listening to musical instruments i,3
And you are right. It encapsulates the great failed lab rat experiment that modern society was. We are all Arthur in some way.,3

Movie was good..... But ranbir acting was flop...... He act like a cartoon characters.....,3
WE are in 2024 and still this movie IS a master Peace,3

Well that's the whole movie just arranged in different order,3
"It's because they have different directors and are not meant to be related. This movie was a stand alone movie on Joker and doesn't have any continuity to Suicide Squad or the Dark Knight movies. I agree though, I like Joaquin as Joker more haha",3

"Japanese culture comes from Tang Dynasty in China, so Japanese characters are highly similar to Chinese characters. Japanese culture and China culture can understand each other. Although the music ""Sakura"" in the video comes from Japan, the pictures and texts in the video are from Chinese paintings.

Moral of the story; don't abuse animals. It might turn out into the biggest action packed thriller of all time. 😉,3

Islam promise of eternal paradise ""وجنات تجري من تحتها الانهار” which literally translates to “Paradise forests where rivers flow under it” here where there are no rivers in the Arabian peninsula and very scarce water sources. I think this movie captures a bit of the essence of the spiritual longing of the Arabs and their cry for life and what gave them the strength to conquer the world during the Islamic conquest.",3

So anyone else ready to admit this movie is incredibly overrated?,3
"This movie sets up this ultimate power the Avenger's now have, which they will never use again or even think about. Tony Stark invents time travel GPS in like... a week? And Thor gets to have a conversation with his mother again, despite her being dead. This means whenever anything comes up Tony in our universe can make a dossier about the problem, deliver it to like 50 different Tony Starks, creating 50 parallel universes, and then they can all think of solutions, and report back to each other and share. Hell, Thor even brings Mjolnir from one universe to our universe to use it. Why not bring Thor #2 for a while? Why not bring 1000 Thors?",3
"This is a possible question someone in the future like myself might ask. Which is: Can u watch Fast and Furious part 21 if u haven't seen the first 20 films? Or is the storyline that vital to understand the overall plot? I like to know these things before I take this type of ""movie"" for a spin.",3
THAT'S REALLY COOL,3
Hi what's going on here thx,3

" @virtualcity721  that’s just the John Wick character, Keanu Reeves is not a bad actor but maybe a limited one. His movies are still very good and his acting doesn’t spoil it at all.",3
"I like that because he's such a cool guy, everyone's just collectively decided to ignore the fact that he can't act. They need to change the main character to Benedict Cumberbatch or even Jake Gyllenhaal. Keanu is maybe the reason I don't like this movie as much as most",3

Also to mention the sound effects which usually comes in between at times gave chills specially in the trial scene or in the speech scene which builds up tension in 15-20 mins was really next level... In Nolan we believe 🖤 A true cinematic genius",3
Part 2 trailer much better than part 3,3

Sab uske fan bane pade hai mam 🎉🎉,3
0:35 imo this shot is Denis Villeneuve wryly agreeing that Dune pt2 is Lawrence of Arabia in space.,3
This movie and infinity war is the reason why we were able to watch at chairs for 5.5 hours straight. They better be as good as these were.,3

"I do enjoy a good john wick film. I give them credit for their imagination. How many ways can you shoot u a few dozen men that you havent shot up before. They managed. The overhead stuff was great. Of course you have to accept the fact that a suit can be not only bullet proof but impact absorbing as well. In all the cop shows, one bullet to a vest knocks a guy out but here just pull the lapel over your face and whalla, dont even pop a blood vessel. Still good entertainment. The previews had more swearing and vulgarities than this movie had. Its a shame Rambo didnt have the decency to end his films like this one. The last rambo. The one after that last one. Where he gets up on a horse. yeah. right. so now we gotta suffer another last one.",3

It's what I have expected to be and more. Can't wait for chapter 5.. They can't kill him yet ...,3
What an incredibly terrible movie. A blind hitman!? Can it get any more ridiculous? I didn't think Reeves' acting could get any worse but somehow he managed to do the impossible. Anyone that thinks this is a good movie is definitely mentally challenged.,3
My heart was beating so fast during the trinity scene. The soundtrack was amazing 😮,3
Yes,3

funny how they changed widow's hair in post production :D,4
lol 😅 come on guys.. I am glad Dom uses the family as a statement of strength. I think in this world we live in we have enough of broken families and damaged stuff to make Dom a family oriented hero. It is a much needed thing in this genre of movies. This is my opinion 👍,4
"Listen I just saw this movie.
I know it’s cringe.
But listen it didn’t have no woke nonsense in it ? 
Am I right ?? 
It’s family .
It’s god.

It’s a father figure. 
Woman don’t bash man .
Man are the strong ones .
Woman depend on the protection of man .  
Anyone ???",4
mumbaiya CGI is the best in the world of cinema😂😂😂😂,4
"I love the part where 1 hour 24 minutes into the movie the production team give up on reality with the script writer with the new God's Eye which miraculously captures the first 9 movies from the same camera angles used in the original movies with 2 fans joining the movie doing the running commentary,",4
When the trailer is better then the movie- perfect example,4
Best movie ever,4
"Like if you’re here after Tiger 3 trailer, which is better?",4
Thanks for this one like,4
"I had put off watching this film as it did not have Fishburne and Weaving in it and I thought... hmmm... not sure about this... so I recently watched the movie but was disappointed, the new characters could not capture the feel of the Matrix and the movie really needed Fishburne and Weaving. I don't know why new productions want to change things up with new characters, they are not the characters we want to see, I want to see the originals, not new characters that are not part of the fabric of the story we all know... I get there can be timing differences, but if you want to make a movie that works well, you need to plan this better. That is my thoughts anyway... but I have a feeling that many feel the same.",4
Best wishes,4
"I love the part where Gerard Butler says “This is Sparta”,  then Dom says “This is Family”.
Truly Oscar-worthy.",4
Masterpiece ❤❤,4
Vin Diesel might be the last guy taking the movies seriously but God bless him for it,4
Wow a trailer that doesn’t try to be goofy 90% of the time. Almost like Disney could learn from phases 1-3,4
"I love the fact that after 12 fast and furious movies, they’ve kept together as a family! Not repetitive and irritating at all……… erm",4
I wish the movie was just as good as the trailer. But it wasn't as bad as the rest of the people felt. Yes people had very high expectations but I guess people did not learn from Star Wars prequels.,4
"Family, Family, Family, got it...its just like the rest. Exactly like the rest. Just make it a TV series.",4

"Don’t get me wrong this is a top tier trailer but I would love to have seen a teaser trailer before this
Opening on a black screen we start see the Avengers logo slowly reassembling from dust, appearing more and more with each line of dialogue, one from 5 of the original 6 Avengers, Clint, Bruce, Thor, Natasha and Steve
Then we get a line from Thanos “I am inevitable” 
As the Avengers symbol completely reassembles and reveals the title we get the closing line from Tony “part of the journey is the end” 
Cut to black",4

They had to hide the ridiculous fact that Trinity had a family of computer programs. All they had to do was suggest that Neo and Trinity were both lonely and lost. Talk about a great setup to revive their love affair. But that Wachowski freak had to throw in some anti-family agenda to muddle this simple love story.,4

Best theater experience I've ever had. It was like being at the Superbowl..😪,4
Best trailer ever,4
They should make more trailers like this. It’s a 3 hour movie and every shot takes place within hour 1. Except 2 shots. It doesn’t tell you anything of the plot. So glad they didn’t put the scenes of them time travelling,4
Iam just here to read all those comments of people which start from “i love the part where………….”,4

"This trailer is awe inspiring. However, they should not have made this, w/o the real Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving. He played as much of a role as Keanu did, making the first 3 as meaningful as they were. The Oracle was there. They just missed 1 piece of the puzzle, to make the puzzle complete.",4
5 years. Absolute masterpiece.,4
Jawan is a superb and full action movie,4
Awesome movie I heard each and every dialogue in the movie,4
Greatest ever. Still goosebumps,4
"Movie turned out to be much better than expected... a well thought out movie, the stories within the movie were literally heart touching.",4
"Bollywood really needs to start making their own content. The movie had a lot of resemblance to Money Heist. 
other than that it was good cz with SRK u can never go wrong.",4
"Just one question. Why little B is black? Lmao. 
Is this a woke thing?😂",4
Me. Still the best one imo,4
Masterpiece,4
"I love the bit where Optimus Dom says ""Now all we need is a little energon, and a lot of family"". Chills fr",4
"​ @Rahmat_2025 no joke only reality
Best director only Siddharth Anand",4
Awesome ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️,4
Tiffany is not really needed. It is Trinity. Love. Trinity and Neo.,4
"I love the part where Dom says ""family is the most important thing"" while he supports organizations and politicians that seek to destroy ""family""",4
"What the f is Brie L’Arse-on doing in the most nitro-sniffing, testosterone-fuelled, manly man, women-objectifying, exciting movie series of all time? Trying to change her image??? Hopefully she won’t ruin any more beloved properties.",4
at this point they can just retroactively add anyone from the past and get to fast 20. fast five and the original one still my favorites,4
Just great as always. Can't wait for the Matrix 5 to come,4
I wish Marvel re-release this movie for their 5 years of ENDGAME,4
The best part was when Morbius joined Neo and said “LET’S MORB THE MATRIX”,4
"As much as I love Jason, this ain't it brotha 😂😂😂",4
Oooowe I love all the Fast and Furious movies. Definitely will be first in line for this one as well,4

"POV: You finally find a comment that doesn't start with ""I love the part""",4
Aquaman have good taste in fashion and sense of humor,4
A movie full of hand to hand combat scenes🔥 Thank You Team Pathaan for making one of the coolest action film ❤,4
"I love the part where Grommash Hellscream yells, ""For the Horde!"" and Dom yells back, ""For my family!"" Such a touching scene.",4
I still in love with oldstyle bollywood,4

This is the best film trailer I've ever seen. Curious how John Wick 4 is gonna beat this.,4
Jhon Abraham highlight movies  Dhoom ❤ pathan  🗿 Rocky handsome,4
"Such a $H1T3 'film'. Enough to warrant executing the self-indulgent, utterly hollow, pseudo-(... everything) creature that was responsible for this. Wouldn't a (non-woke) therapist have been cheaper and FAR kinder to humanity?",4
Might be one of the best trailers I've ever seen... shame it wasn't one of the best films I've ever seen.. This trailer version music really made it pop...,4
This trailer and the song is easily the best part of the movie.,4
"I actually hated the use of the song even though I like the song outside of this trailer. Absolutely no Matrix vibe to any of this. The trailer is utter garbage if you actually care about film and what that brings and especially so if you've been a fan of the Matrix trilogy. And I'm not talking about people who watch movies as a passtime activity or are hung up on editing, special effects and how ""eeeepic"" the trailer is. To the real ones... Cheers.",4
My diabolical funny hilarious plan,4
i remember when this trailer first came out. best legendary editing!!!,4
Marvel when it wasn’t a joke,4

Man, i'm gonna miss Paul Walker! 😭😭😭",4
Best movie ever. 🎉,4
"Funny to see how both Vin and Jason are both old and chunky, yet try to play the same characters they played in the late 20s",4
"Pathaan trailer was next level!!! Absolutely superb & showed all characters. Who is here after the trashy tiger3 trailer with cartoon vfx? 😭

What a masterpiece,4
Masterpiece ❤❤,4
Please come back old avenger I miss that heros Please,4
 @imranrashid1341  yes bro masterpiece,4
Sahoo is 10 times better than pathaan who will agree,4
"Greatest movie the human being watched,Americans,you are genius🇪🇬🇺🇸❤",4

Leave your old crew join my crew the best crew,4
The best crew in everything,4
I wish the movie was as good as this trailer,4
Haven’t seen this yet but jawan and dunki was really good,4
"I can't believe so many people hate this movie. I finally watched it on Netflix and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. I am 44 however and I feel I really 'get' this film, and can relate to Neo and Trinity's predicament (before they are freed). I liked the first Matrix, good action with a strong message, but could barely sit through its sequels as they were shallow and pointless. The Matrix 4 actually has a lot to say about today's society, especially the corporate entertainment and medical industries, and society's blind surrender to them while living personally repressed and unfulfilled lives. I think a lot of these messages passes over the head of the younger generations and the action though good, is not cool enough to pull their interest.",4
Han is the best character in this entire franchise,4
The best spy film from yrf. It must go on. Awaiting for upcoming sequel ❤ from Bangladesh 🇧🇩,4
"The movie was OK, I have mixed feelings about Trinity having the power now, but it was a good closure.",4
Love it,4
Almost 5 years since this. Still one the best superhero movies of all time. Infinity War being the other best ofcourse.,4
This trailer is 100 times better than Tiger 3 trailer. Best trailer of spy universe 🔥,4
My favorite movie <3,4
Srk is the best,4
Masterpiece ❤❤❤🎉🎉,4
Pathaan is best 🔥,4
I love the part of crashing each 🚁 🥵💥,4
Masterpiece trailer😮😮😮😮😮,4
"This movie is more about sending a message to the viewers than it is about entertainment. The message is expertly delivered, almost as well as the first movie. 
 
It's funny how most people who watch it either miss the message entirely, improperly interpret it or fail to realize that the people in the pods represent everyone of US; especially those of us who think that we're ""woke"". 

The Matrix represents the economic/educational system to which we are all tied.

Also: The first song at the end of the movie is a nice remake of Rage Against The Machine's ""Wake Up"". It gives younger people a chance to hear truth in music.",4
Awesome,4
"He isnt Thanos but still okay i guess, better than nothing",4
Pathaan is the most celebrated Agent of spy universe. SRK's charm was enough for d fans,4
Just came back after watching the Ms Marvels trailer with an avenger music on its background. This trailer is worth the hundred Ms marvels Ngl MCU.,4
I like the trailer better than the movie.,4
"I love the part where Juanki Loco says ""UNO, DOS LE SACO EL ARROZ, TRES, CUATRO, EN EL ACTO SE LA DESBARATO"" and Dom says ""PICHA SE MAMA HPTA you don't mess with my family...""",4
I'm bringing the original perfect diabolical fahim,4
"The Wachowski Sisters are for blockbuster cinema the equivalent that Richard Kelly (director of Donnie Darko) is for independent cinema, that is, both are filmmakers whose only good ideas were used in their first works, and from there it's just a bunch of mediocre project, or at least questionable quality.",4
Best trailer in spy universe 🦁🔥,4
Little did we know this would be the last genuinely great thing the MCU made before it fell off.,4
Pathaan records are safe as tiger 3 trailer is pretty average 🦁,4
Pathaan is better & best 🔥,4
2025 ❤ 🖐 & still love the trailer 😍,4

The best part of this movie will be the closing credits,4

" @fountainredhaiter9882  Captain America (Anthony Mackie) was facing weird stuff in the new Avengers team. It wasn't like the old team, which seemed much simpler to handle. Dr Strange helped him though. They also teamed up with Reed Richards (Fantastic Four) and more interesting scientific stuff happened. Oh, but you should see how Deadpool and Spidey played their roles there. They're hilarious 😂",4

This movie will age like good wine.,4
Don't forget we also had Homi J Bhabha....And huge respect for Oppenheimer also... 🔥🔥,4
"Certainly! J. Robert Oppenheimer's life was marked by several controversies, which contributed to his eventual downfall. Here are some of the key controversies associated with him:
1. Political Associations: Oppenheimer's early political affiliations and associations with left-wing organizations during his youth attracted suspicion and scrutiny during the McCarthy era. He had connections with communist sympathizers and was associated with various left-leaning groups. These associations raised concerns about his loyalty and potential security risks, leading to investigations into his background.

2. Loyalty Concerns: Oppenheimer's vocal opposition to the use of nuclear weapons after World War II, combined with his past political associations, raised doubts about his loyalty to the United States. During the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) hearings in 1954, he faced accusations of being a security risk and having communist sympathies. This ultimately led to the revocation of his security clearance.

3. The Oppenheimer Security Hearing: The security hearing conducted by the AEC in 1954 was a highly controversial event that dealt a significant blow to Oppenheimer's career. The hearing aimed to determine whether Oppenheimer's security clearance should be renewed. The proceedings were characterized by tense interrogations and testimonies from various individuals, including fellow scientists and colleagues. Oppenheimer's loyalty, political beliefs, and judgment were scrutinized, and the hearing resulted in the revocation of his security clearance.

4. Ethical Responsibility: Oppenheimer faced criticism for his role in the development of the atomic bomb. Some argued that he should have exercised greater moral and ethical judgment, considering the catastrophic consequences of the weapon. Oppenheimer's own conflicted views on the use and proliferation of nuclear weapons, combined with his involvement in their creation, added to the controversy surrounding his legacy.

5. Postwar Activism: Following his security clearance revocation, Oppenheimer became involved in various activist and political endeavors. He publicly advocated for nuclear arms control, disarmament, and international control of atomic energy. These activities further fueled controversy and polarized opinions about his intentions and loyalties.

It is important to note that the controversies surrounding Oppenheimer were deeply entwined with the political climate of the time and the broader context of the Cold War. These events reflect the heightened tensions, suspicions, and ideological conflicts prevalent during the McCarthy era and the Second Red Scare. Oppenheimer's legacy remains a subject of ongoing debate, as different perspectives continue to shape the narrative surrounding his life and contributions.",4
ITS TIME FOR CILIAN TO SHOW THAT HE IS THE BEST FUKCING ACTOR IN THE WORLD ❤❤❤🔥🔥🔥remember the name CILIAN MURPHY☺️,4
"This Is so emotional, One of the best trailer i've ever seen",4
"Disney:  ""Why is he a played by a white guy? Why not a black woman who never makes mistakes? Is there at least going to be a lesbian kiss in the background?""",4
Oppenheimer was a genuine good guy. I'm glad I don't have to call out Nolan for white washing history. I can chill.,4
I remember going to Japan and hearing this on the streets of Kyoto. Great memories. My favorite place was the park with deer in Nara.,4
I hope it's a joke,4
Sir Christopher Nolan best director our generation forget about mavel or dc I'm big fan sir Christopher Nolan,4
So happy for cillian murphy,4
If you think about it god is more less saying yous can't do a simple thing and love each other so here's my wrath,4
Why does this sound like inazuma OSTs from genshin.. like the entire arrangement reminds me of it,4
"White people still so happy. Hahah, For a scientist who created a bomb to annihilate  so many others. Good job, White people hahahah",4
I feel like this trailer alone gives me hope for the future of filmmaking!! Can't wait to see this in theaters!!,4
Yes lmfao its so random,4
0:28 to 0:43 souds like Megitsune (Babymetal).  Perhaps the band was inspired by this song.,4
This movie is gonna be the bomb,4
"I think Network was the most prescient film of all in which a company, and us by proxy, sells it's soul for giving us what we want to hear and see. It would be the height of irony if Oppenheimer proves better by going into our past to foretell an inevitable consequence...and nobody is left to watch it over and over again.",4
"Glad to see Cillian Murphy and RDJ together, i wish this movie to become a milestone in their career.......",4
any Christopher Nolan film is going to be a masterpiece and that is certain,4

The story is all the more beautiful that Cilian Murphy has finally had his leading role with Christopher Nolan,4
"I'm a STEM geek, and as long as they get the math and science correct,  I'm  happy.  Although, based on the tour de force of his Interstellar film, I have complete faith he will nearly get everything right here.",4
"They won't fear it, until they understand it.
And once they understand it, only then, they will fear.",4

This is my personal opinion men are brave please include your next trailer ❤,4

This is Actually it Will Be The First Robert Downey jr Good Movie and The Most Important One In His Career He Never Dream To Work With A Great Diractor Like Christopher Nolan And Even Be in One Of His Films - all of his movies kinda being a stu*d hollow Cgi and getting paid millions of dollars for nothing - OR - making some dumb*ss movies with a bad storylines and screenplay - OR - making some reboot on an old movies,4

the lyrics and subject of the song arent sad. But it sounds sad.,4
"Thousands upon thousands of our soldiers would have died when we decided to invade Japan. Thanks to Oppenheimer and members of the Manhattan Project, they saved those soldiers' lives with their 3+ years of dedication and hard work to develope the weapon that would force Japan to surrender! Because of that, they true American heroes!",4

Finished watching the movie an hour ago. No words can express the anxiety I felt when the detonation scene played. The sheer silence and then the loud ass kaboom🥲 WOW!
Overall the movie was an emotional rollercoaster. Nobody could've made this movie more better than Chris Nolan.

On par with Beethoven's 5th Symphony for the development of its theme.",4
"I remember bumping into Murphy numerous times in Cork in the early 90s after his band had finished their gigs in a small club.

"""I don't know if we can we be trusted with this weapon. But, I know the Nazis can't"" but the Nazis had access to very powerful bio-chemical weapons which they refused to use them on humanitarian reasons. They could have easily won at Normandy. So the yanks made a neuclear weapon and we saw what they did with it. Needless to say i aint ever watching this filth. Question is: why would any1? ;-)",4
"I‘m happy I bought a ticket, this is my first time going to Cinema and Oppenheimer worth it ❤",4
Cannot wait to experience the movie and see how everything we’ve heard about Oppenheimer and the story is visualized like this. As a Japanese I’ve heard a lot about him growing up. Good things.,4
Beauty and harmony. Governed by one eternal law. All that begins must end.,4
"Really rooting for this movie to be released 😁
It's been a long time..
Murphy just fits in every role he  is the greatest actor of all time

"By invite only from my MIT of Cambridge, MA. endorsed peer reviewed articles on Prior Art on of for by isotopic fueled nuclear atomic power with Dr. Peter Hagelstein, Dr. Mitchell Swartz, and Dr.  Brian Ahern we often have had cited Oppenheimer's papers.

"Dr. Mitchell Swartz said ""most youngsters no longer go into nuclear fields like they used to"" while I have ambitions for nuclear to achieve interdimensional travel between parallel universes & how to circumvent light barrier along with airships of Robert L Morisons patented lighter than air solids having nuclear powered jet engines to replace rail transit locomotives & replace agriculture with vats of electroporated Knall Gas bacteria or cell culture.  
 
Because of my MIT work on isotopic fuels I met others interested in electroporation and laser metalluugical tools and even a Carl Page who interested in fermentation vats to biomineralize metals.",4
It has to be seen on the Biggest screen possible.... ❤A Masterpiece,4
This song is not about the “peaceful vibes” and all. It’s like a mystery or some ghost trying to speak by an instrument and i think that is definitely why i like the sound of this,4
"​ @PopsiCOLE  Nolan ""proved"" that you can make really great-looking movies using nothing but practical effects... That's been a fact for a long time before Nolan, though.
Seems to me the way you look at it is ""practical effects = special effects that look good"" versus ""CGI effects = special effects that look bad"".

Iduno... I just can't get my head around that kind of limited thinking. Whatever, we don't agree. Go back to jerking off Batman-posters you minion. I be done with ye.",4
Pretty confident this is going to be the most extraordinary movie I'll ever see.,4
"The 1st A-bomb dropped on Hiroshima was code named Lttle Boy. This was the Gun type weapon and was not tested as the physicists were confident that it would work. The one at Trinity was the more efficient Implosion/compression type and the physicists were unsure of this method until the Trinity test. I recommend seeing ""The Beginning or the End"" 1947 B&W a somewhat fictional account after all it was just 2years after the fact and the details were still Top Secret. Then ""Above and Beyond"" 1952 B&W which was more centered on Col. Paul Tibbets who flew the Enola Gay over Hiroshima. And ""Fat Man and Little Boy"" 1989 starring Paul Newman, Dwight Schultz and John Cusack which does center around Los Alamos and the Trinity test..",4
Absolutely gorgeous!! 💯,4

" @gmar7836 well Your different. I'm just saying that people are going to call this movie whatever they want. Freedom of speech and all that good stuff.  I get what your trying to do, I really do, but posting on YouTube about what you should or shouldn't say about a movie is a bit ridiculous. Kids these days have a completely different vocabulary than other generations and they are going to say what they want whether you like it or not.",4
"""Linkin Park - The Catalyst"" track from the album A Thousand Suns would get featured in the film, a perfect match. Joe Hahn saying it was influenced by J. Robert Oppenheimer 
Hahn said he thought about what it would be like if mankind had to accept their fate in a time of despair.",4
"I wish I could have said that Nolan actually dropped a nuke for the shot. Unfortunately, Nolan is also bound by international law, so while the effect is practical and was filmed on site, the bomb was not a nuke, but just an extraordinary amount of TNT creating a mushroom cloud.",4
This feels so honorable to me..,4

"I’ve asked so many people since this trailer’s been released.. are you going to see Oppenheimer when it comes out. Almost universally the response is … Oppenheimer? Who’s that? 

Now that’s scary 😂 it’s amazing to me how many people live in their white picket fence bubbles who know nothing about this event or history in general. Good lord help us from these people who walk among us. 

I get that you can’t spend your whole life worrying day in and day out wether this could ever happen. Or for that matter how many times it’s nearly happened in our history…but to know absolutely nothing about it is astonishing to me.",4
Lol then u find out that Oppenheimer said that as a justification to building the bomb rather than a reason to not do so because of his ego,4

"5/10 no mentions in the movie of the actual scientific underpinnings and struggles during the project,  too much screen time dedicated to Strauss, transition in oppenheimer personality when becoming the project lead not depicted,  his tremendous intellect and quickness as well, trinity test scene feels unclimatic...
They focused too much on the political assiette instead of the tremendous step in science and humanity",4

"Entertaining movie,  everyone did wonderful work and Tabbu and  Kartik nailed their characters.",4
Just finished watching Bhool Bhulaiya 1. Huge fan! Vidya Balan’s psychotic dance “Ami je Tomar” and the possessed character of Manjulika at the end still gives me goosebumps!!,4

Look at this man .. what a masterpiece.. what a story .. what a direction .. dialogues … acting .. absolutely fantastic ❤️✅  Kartik Aryan wow man 🔥🔥",4
"BB1 was superb for the simple reason that comedy was inherent in its storyline....comedy was forcefully introduced in the sequel. In addition, the storyline of the sequel is too vague.. Poorly made sequel with no sincere efforts",4
Best marvel movie in history,4
Akshay Kumar is best,4
Nice movie. Support Karthik Aryan. Don't let his fate be like SSR.,4

Faltu movie bhool bhulaiya 1 is the best,4
Watched the movie now... What a disaster... Stain upon the original I wud say... Just endlessly trying to bank on the music and nuances of the original... Don't waste your money or time upon this one!,4
Akshay Kumar will be always being Akshay but Kartik s performance is just fabulous,4
Loved the movie wasn’t expecting to be that good 👍👍,4

She seems lost in the movie 🍿.
The chemistry between Tabu and Karthik very amazing 💚🤎😎",4
 @ksaweryjanowski827  yeah I haven’t gotten that far. Lol 😂 I think I watched like one or two shows that were on Disney plus and gave up. Just not the same anymore.,4
Totally amazing,4
"@hazman5528  These yes, But also TFATWS, WandaVision, Agatha All Along, What If (especially season 1), Hawkeye, Wakanda Forever, Werewolf by Night, GOTG Holliday Special, etc. The worst ones are Secret Invasion and Ms Marvel to me, the rest are actually enjoyable.",4
Awesome movie....mazedaar,4
"But that cast of Akshay Kumar, Vidya Balan, Ameesha Patel & Shiney Ahuja in BB1 is the best.",4
A self indulgent pity party. God I’m so fed up with Marvel.,4
Not yet but soon my friend,4
Man what has Bollywood come to... This level of stupidity... Wish we could get to see good movies like in the 90s & 2000s.,4

After watching the movie Bhulbulaiya I can feel Anjalika and I can feel the fear of Kartik sir even though I know her acting and I am impressed by their acting I really want to see Kartik sir and Kira ma'am once if the wish is fulfilled,4
Best movie of 2023,4
love the movie so so much,4
Akshay Kumar was the best bhool bhulajya,4
Nothing in this dogshit movie makes sense LMAO,4
Kartik aryan is the best movie of bhool bhulaiya but Akshay no best,4
"Hi, non-Indian here. I quite enjoyed the movie. Kartik is funny and easy on the eyes. My only complaint is the ending, I mean that's it? I thought they were gonna show the ghost moving on, Ruhaan and Reet, the family, the wedding, and stuff.",4
I love seeing Laurence Fishburne and Keanu Reeves in the same movie,4
Best,4

I swear this is one of the best movies and trailers ever😊,4
Love John wick so much,4

Best movie,4
Great movies,4
"If I follow my instinct and experience with lot of products,I think that John Wick,Donnie Yen and Keanu Reeves made few very good movies and now it's turn of the bad or not good enough ones.

It's only movies don't get attached cause when it's time to view the thing the result is the result and you can find lot better.
Well new releases could be a option.",4
Thanks for your love and concern where are you from.,4
Thanks for the unconditional love ❤,4
Thanks for the unconditional love ❤,4

Praise the LORD for creating the color green.,4
Old is best,4
Keanu reeves my son's name you my best actor and the strongest man I know,4
Great movie,4
"John Wick is one of the best action movies I've ever seen👌🏻 If I want to evaluate it, of course, I will say 10/100❤️‍🔥 I love John's character because he is good at everything and all kinds of fighting, and he is a loyal man in love, but his style of killing and he doesn't leave anyone as much as life, his banner always attracts me to complete the movie(Dana nooh)",4
Akshey Kumar is a best actor in Bhool bhulaiya  isme bhi akshey hota tu acha hota,4
Akshay Kumar is best for this movie,4
"This is a beautiful and absolutely bonkers film.  The cinematography is rich, the dialogue spare but memorable, and the action choreography remains unmatched.  The film benefits from ensemble casting and even minor characters are fascinating.  One of the car fu stunts is so outrageous yet completely plausible that I laugh out loud every time I watch it.  I managed to see it 9 times in the theater.  No franchise can surpass John Wick.  I am grateful.",4
Best actor 👍,4
The Warriors 1979 film reminded me of the JWick films XD,4
It’s simply the best movie ever made.,4
AMAZING MOVIE WONDERFULL WAY TO CREAT SUSPENCE AND TWIST EVEN THE TRAILER IS FALSE!gg,4
Still best 😎still beast 💪🏼 still legend 💀,4

"Indian actresses are ready to kiss anyone as well love to wear open dress for showing their assets and this is their success.. 
There is no value without kissing and open dress.
Stupid things",4
Bakwas move. Nowhere close to part 1. All great actors but bakwas concept. Bhoot can fly and what not. All villagers accept that you can talk to bhoot and believe weird stuff. Nothing like part 1. Great directing and story in part one. Very close to real life. Second one is comedy in every part. 2 stars from me.,4
Donnie Yen is the best fighter,4
The best movies 👑,4
One of the best movie trailers ever made.,4
THIS IS NICE MOVIE 👍.. But not as much comedy.likr the original one 😢.... why Akshay Kumar sir is not there in the movie 😤😤,4

Legend always legend Askhay Kumar is best,4
Comedy king Akshay Kumar best and Raj pal mast,4

The best trailer I seen,4
Bakwaas akshy is best,4
Great trailer,4
Though during the whole film I was missing the Bhool Bhulaiyaa 1 movie. But I enjoyed the movie and last twist was cherry on the top.,4
Akshay kumar is best caracter Bhul bhulya part 1 is best........old is gold 🔥🔥🔥,4
Mohanlal is best,4

It's weird that dp 3 cost twice as much as JW 4 but when you take into account promoting dp3 vs the losses over the past few years on other marvel films dp 3 is basically recouping those losses while jw4 is pure profit.,4
"Nice to see Hiroyuki Sanada featuring, he never does a bad role.",4
Mohanlal best hai,4
Superhero Movies like Deadpool 3 makes Billion dollars easily but people fails to appreciate a well made movie like John wick 4. they couldn't support John wick to make billion dollars.,4
Akshay kumar best actor.....,4
Bhool bhulaiya 1 was too good. The Directer was well aware where to place comedy and where to horror. But this movie is typical this time Bollywood movie 😒. But i must say this is better than another nowadays movies 🤣,4
EAST YOUR WEST T SERIES IS BEST,4
Great movie!!!!,4
1:44  the way he laughed made it more exciting It was like a moment of desperate,4
Fun fact : sahi kaha jaye to is movie mein aur betaal web series mein zyada fark nahi tha betaal mein asa tha ki agar wo tunnel khul gayi to betaal aur uski zombie fauj maar dalengi aur is movie mein asa tha ki agar manjulika ka darwaja khul gaya to manjulika maar dalengi lol,4

" @skandamurgan4378  It's illegal in much of the West as well, but yeah you can still get away with it if you just use a VPN properly.

But if showrunners want money, they probably shouldn't force people who want to try the show out to download the show first and then maybe give them money afterward if they think to, lol.  Not too many people are going to DL a show, watch the first two episodes, pause, and evaluate from there whether or not they want to pay for it.  They'll just binge the rest of the freely-downloaded show, never feeling too compelled to pay for it.",4

"The other day this song came on during world history class. I'm not sure what my teacher uses for his music playlist, but this was in it. Keep in mind most of the kids in my class probably don't even know this show exists. The only reason I do is because sometimes it would come on late at night when I was 10 or so, and I would watch it then. Anyways, some of us were mouthing the lyrics while others were just laughing, seemingly in confusion or because they wondered how some of us knew the lyrics. It was a fun time though.",4

"Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it""
First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said, ""Fresh"" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air""
I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie, ""Yo holmes, smell ya later""
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air",4
This still isn't the full version. The greatest hits album has extra lyrics and the full version of this song.,4

This unnecessary waste of CGI insults its audience on every level, attaching painful hubris and cloying gravitas to the most cliched and well trodden statements. And, tepid acting and by the numbers Other World story arcs aside......please, for the love of chemical chance, can this sludh be the final appearance, pretty please, of invented languages which are blatant Jabba the Hut ripoffs. Zendaya gets points for frckability, but if youre over 14, or female, this movie will take a few hours from your life, and give you brain ulcers, at best.",4

I liked the trailer when it came and was excited to see it when it came out.. Always loved lonely island,4
The best show I have ever watched. I miss watching this back when I was about 8 years old. My mom didn’t like it. Where does the time go??,4

Trailer was....meh but the series is awesome.,4
Patrick Bateman yes it’s really good.,4
This is a story all about how I slapped Chris rock and sat back down now some people say I’m wrong but I don’t care that’s why you don’t make jokes about wifey not having hair,4

Best show on TV right now.,4
"9.0 / 10 🍿  
Great Movie 🍿",4
"If you've never read the book, it's an OK movie. If you have and love the story, it's an abomination. They twisted the story, changed characters, took conversations between two people and had two completely different people have them, and destroyed the beauty of Chan and Paul's love. It was so bad we had a hard time getting through the second half of the second film. If they make another one, we will not be watching it.",4
the beginning of a masterpiece,4
the Best Franchise ever made in 2023's!!!!,4
one of the best science fiction movies I've ever seen,4
"Trailer looks terrible.....Hows the show???????
Any reviews are much appreciated",4
Perhaps the greatest modern sitcom there is.,4
"Is it a good series ? 
Like the big bang theory",4
 @Cottencandyrain  - Its a great show. You should watch it,4
Best movie of the year. Period.,4
"The trailer wasn’t great, but this is only footage from the first episode. It gets much better",4
"Not immersive, long, boring. Sets are unimpressive. Main character is a soy boy with a face and figure of a prepubescent girl - completely miscast. Movie feels like an adventure videogame where main character moves from one quest to another from one NPC to the next. Worms were badly made , riding them was even worse sequence (made for TV quality). Movie had a cheap shot-in-studio feel to it. Did I mention there was no story to be immersed in. The director wanted to do a character evolution but it felt abrupt & staged at the end of the movie. This movie looked like another Marvel or  Batman saga for infantile  American men.",4
"Thats the best show I ever saw, go and watch it please",4
PELÍCULON!!!!❤❤❤❤  I'VE JUST LOVE IT!!!!!,4
Its not even fair how much better this movie is to win a Oscar over Anora,4

It took a whole season -- totally love it now on Netflix,4
Your free Supreme,4
"There is this cool movie called idiocracy. It's basically about how the people on earth become incredibly stupid. So there is a store called fut buckers. And the name of the store is a symbol of how stupid we are, that were able to throw away any sort of morals and replace them with low intellectual entertainment. Later on in the movie, they just ended up calling the store butt fuckers. But it's funny how you live life, observe and watch these realities come true.",4
one of the best shows ever !!!!,4
I love this theme song!,4
Rusty: I love how you included the start of the episode in this video too!,4

"Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it""
First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said, ""Fresh"" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air""
I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie, ""Yo holmes, smell ya later""
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air",4
"I disagree, Emily Hampshire, who plays Stevie is hands down the best character. She has made deadpan sarcasm an art and I'm laughing so hard everytime she is on screen.",4

"This could possibly be the wackest song ever recorded!  But It has generated millions of dollars and is known worldwide. Now if you’re a music producer or an artists, just think about that for second. No one cares about how good you or your music is, you won’t make any money unless you put your music to work somewhere. It’s not about you, its about the placement and the work.",4
"Exactly I see comments like this that ""this trailer dosent do justice to show in ever single show trailer I ever watched""​ @st6645 ",4

"As a 2005 kid growing up on this show, my brain is absolutely boggled hearing this song without the lines; ""is this the kind of place that they should send this cool cat?"" and, ""there was a dude standin there with my name out. I ain't tryna get arrested yet, I just got here"". Its a total mandela affect. I must have watched the episodes on old pirating sites, not even cable, to hear the absolute OG theme.",4
the thing that made me watch this show was jenifer goines :D,4
The head swirl is iconic. I hope will knows that lol,4
"Live the show but it seems to be turning into the Alexis and Davod hookup show, which is getting kind of obnoxious. More comedy, less romance please",4

Well actually I did stumble upon this absolute masterpiece,4
I’m convincing my mother to like Will Smith!,4
DA BEST THEME SONG,4
"Adam Newman on Pure Comedy Sirius XM 30 seconds ago brought me here. I had no idea there was a second verse with a plane. I didn’t even finish listening to the joke. But it made sense that if it was just a cab Will took, it would’ve cost that broke Fresh Prince $5900. This full version was only played in the first 3 episodes.

Now I’m going back to rewind that joke 😂",4
I love how the end of this intro was transitioning into the start of the first episode,4
"I still sing this song after all these years. But in my language: ""Willy, il principe di Bel Air."" I wanted to listen to the original one. Cool!",4
"I begged and pleaded with her day after day

"This is not the full song. There’s at least 16 lines missing.

6 of them are:
“But wait, I hear they’re prissy
Bouigeous and all that
Is that the type of place
they could send this cool cat?
I don’t think so, I’ll see when I get there
I hope they’re prepared for the Prince of Bel Air!”",4

The best era . I remember those days.😢,4

Lol my son mikey yup 👍 🤣 sunglasses the new will smith is mikey lol,4
They changed this up lol 😆 haha,4
"Which was a copy of a Colombian show called Pobres Rico. But at least they had the rights to remake it. The Levy's seem to be passing this one off as an original. So far your comment is the first thing I've seen indicating it isn't original. It's wayyy too similar though, isn't it?",4
"So many shows copy their basic premises from other shows - a lot of English-language sitcoms steal from Latin America and vice versa. Sometimes unintentionally, because things like rich people losing everything and acting like idiots are funny everywhere.",4
i love this song,4
Watched 3 episodes on CBC and I think I like it. Will be watching again. Love Chris Elliott.,4
Absolute best part of the show. Lol shes how i imagine a ling time soap actress would act.,4

One of the best theme tunes in TV History.,4

Greatest intro ever ❤❤❤,4
"I know one episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, that Tom Jones guest started on the season 3 episode “The Alma Matter” (aired February 8, 1993, filmed in 1992) when he had walk-on part during a dream sequence on this show and sang a special version of “It’s Not Unusual”.",4
I'm in 2025 yo I love this,4
ive never watched a single episode of this show and this is a masterpiece,4
great writing but alexis character makes me cringe... the show would be more enjoyable without her in it.,4
"Absoluteuly the best written, directed and acted show.  Most do not realize that Miora is the Mom on Home Alone.  Eugene Levy is the Dad of Daniel (the gay son) and the dad of Twilla (Sarah Levy).  Hilarious all the way!",4

 In west Philadelphia born and raised on the playground is where i spend most of my days

Chilling out maxing relaxing all cool n all shooting some b ball out side of the school

When a couple of guys they were up to no good! Started making trouble in the neighborhood

I got in 1 little fight and my mom got scared and said ""your moving with your auntie and uncle in bell air ""

I begged and pleaded with her the other day and she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way

She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket i put my walkman on and said i might as well KICK IT 

First class yo this is bad drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass

Is this what the people of bel air living like? Hmm this might be alright

I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said fresh and has dice in the mirror 

If anything id say this cab was rare but i thought man forget it YO HOLMES TO BEL AIR 

i pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 and i yelled to the cabby yo Holmes smell ya later 

Looked at ky kingdom i was finally there 

To sit on my throne as the prince of bell air 


(I forced myself to learn this song when i was 9 it rly payed off i love this show to this day )",4
"I wasn’t even born in the 90s I was born in the late 2000’s but I was obsessed with this intro when I was younger. Also the show full house, I absolutely loved it.",4
this is a masterpiece,4
I love this series!!!,4
Love this show and I watch it over & over!,4
Pop song ❤the Masterpiece song ❤,4
Totally recommend it. Only if you promise to binge watch it.,4
Bro will smith gave me joy  in the introduction of this  I watched it with my whole family on Halloween I mean like yass,4
I like laughing,4
I only started getting interested in this show after it won all its Emmys for its last season,4
"Just came to know that it won all 7 comedy awards at Emmys 2020, but the trailer seems quite boring! Is it that good or what? Will have to see 1-2 episodes to confirm 😬",4
"The trailer doesn't do it any justice! I watched the whole thing in 2 weeks, SOOOOO GOOOOOOD!!!",4
Love me some Jeffrey and Uncle Phil ! ❤ Xo Joey Babaaayyy!,4
yes. love them all. brilliant...,4
"Ok, just watched the trailer for the first time and I think I’m gonna give it a try. Seems funny.",4
"I jus finished binge watching this show, I’m so happy with how it ended especially for David, he deserves it !!!! Furthermore , go watch this series!!!!!!",4
Please make way for Emmy winners.,4
I swear to god I’m here because this show won so many damn emmys I’m like I gotta see wtf this is. And I’m definitely going to check it out because it looks Hilarious,4
"Hope the show is a LOT better than this pathetic trailer.

For now, it certainly LOOKS/SOUNDS like the typical garbage on Nutflix.",4
Trailer is shit... LITERALLY... One of the best shows I've ever seen!!!,4
"I gave this a swerve for a while because of the title. I thought it may be another US attempt of making comedy out of smut,but no!  It's great! The son cracks me up!",4
I really wish I understood american humor or just humor I didn't laugh at one single part of that trailer. It's the same with stand up shows. The glioma i've been burdened with has removed my ability to find stuff funny. I used to like comedy. On the brightside though it's kinda cool that i'm now like some type of (mutated) bond villain who's had his empathy and humor taken away. Roll on the evil masterplans..,4
I love this show ❤️,4
I’m watching it for the 3rd time. I just LoVe this show.,4
Well it's got Tick Pickwick in it so must be good right?,4
Love this show,4
1:55 SO FUNNY,4
"I never even was around when this aired and I could just feel the nostalgia wash over me like a tsunami (never even seen an episode until living with my cousins and heading to their grandma's place one time, I think either thanksgiving or a christmas party with other relatives my cousins knew). just shows how good a bop this is even in this modern era",4
"FOR WOMEN:

Love holds little value for men. They pursue it only in times of vulnerability.
Men crave POWER above all else.
DO NOT sacrifice everything for a man.
BE EMPOWERED, be bold, be resilient. 😠",4

I just finished all 6 seasons and I recommend everyone to watch it! It is so worth it!,4
"Love this series so m

" @ajaxmajor  We have been conditioned down to the attention span of a dog (Including me). You just read the first sentence and asked the question. The second sentence answered your question indicating you did not read or catch it.
Watching the finale will either appease your interest in the show or start the curiosity of what happened. There are 80 episodes to sit through and our viewing habits/attention span won't allow for it.
It is like watching Gilligan's Island finale and then making the decision if you want to watch the beginning.",4

"Just watched part 1 again last night,  still awesome.   Can't wait for this one.",4
True creativity. In the meantime Disney is looting its own archives and churning out dross,4
The original dune cast were really beautiful,4
I Hope Denis continues to make movies on the rest of the series. May not be possible… but I want to see his rendition of the God Emperor… SO BAD!!!!!!!,4
So they're just going to spoil the part where this dude straight up learns how to ride one of the giant worms successfully in the trailer?  marketing team moment,4
What a wonderul music! Here is a beautiful guitar piece based on this theme too... https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3lOKF8hxXw4,4

"A very intetesting wiev on the musical scale-types. You are total right. My own burning intetests are directly japanese and the ancient egyptians. The accords are so close in style, and both very beautyfull!!! I always gives me goosbumps, in a good way, to listen to both japanese and egyptian music... its living and you want to dance or sing along when you listen. So Beautyfull!!!!",4
 @_diaz_0 there’s only 3 actually good Star Wars movies and Dune part 1 is better than all of them lmfao.,4

" @jonplaud  Yeah, your right. You could never stick Mickey Mouse ears on Dune. Far too adult and awesome.",4
Great music,4
"ok so I have an explanation for that. The japanese scale is a minor pentatonic scale or a hirajoshi pentatonic. You get this when you get a natural minor scale and take out the 4th and 7th degrees. BUT. if you get keep these 4th and 7th degrees and raise them a semitone, you get the double harmonic minor scale. This is a scale commonly used in middle eastern cultures, hence the ""Egyptian sound"".",4
They should bring back the Empire of Japan flag. A glorious flag that it is.,4
You can’t compare the Japanese tradition Art to other Styles.. but I see where you coming from :),4
Egyptian Music inspired most cultures to make music like the Greeks 🙂... There's some history for ya,4

I love the clothing in these movie.,4
"@Kid Patel Well, Mulan doesn't even have a full story, it's an old poem from China that everyone learns when they are young. Just like I said, they will make a whole different story with Disney standards, so I don't see a problem to Japan have their own Disney princess.",4
"@Kid Patel Ok, ok. You're very stubborn when it comes to Japan's culture, but why tho? The stories can't be original, but it's just a culture influence, just like the Greek stuff in Roma. This have been in the human history on almost all the cultures, and doesn't matter at all, I'll like them all because it will come in their little way even if it is the same story .",4
This looks so good!!!,4
I seriously cant wait for this. Dune is one of my favorite book series and theyre doing them justice,4
" @ahmedrafi4611  yeah i worded that badly, ye friends! :D",4
" @laleczkowa  You should watch it, it's very worth it! The final parts made me cry so much, even thought that movie was made for children. It's very good for self reflection, I recommend it.",4
 @chubbs-thechubbyninja4719  hahaha its ok,4
"Yes, this is just one of the many things I found to be actually good to learn... and this is the movie where I actually get motivated... unlike any marvel stupidity.",4

Disney has already defiled enough cultural literature from Pocahontas to Winnie the Pooh. Let's hope they don't make a story about a Japanese princess. Let's hope Ghibli Studio to tell the real story with real art.,4
Love Dune,4
Could I use this music in my audiovisual projects? I don't know if this is for free use or what kind of copyright it has... thank you,4
It's because of the strikes. The cast is filled with stars so there will be a lot of promo and they didn't want to waste it. Honestly a shame because they should've filmed dune 1 and 2 at the same time but hey they just changed the date to March 1st so 2 weeks earlier. Not much but still we can wait for this amazing movie,4
" @erlanggaalamsyah2481   Gamelan Sunda and Bali is way too strong and loud, Gamelan Melayu is a relaxing version of Gamelan. Gamelan Jawa is really fast if you ask me.",4

Both movies are great. They have nothing on the books. I'm still looking forward to this.,4
Cannot wait for another masterpiece 🎉,4
"I get chills every time I watch this, it’s only a trailer but it’s a cinematic masterpiece. Can’t wait for the movie!",4
It's gonna be another snooze fest just like the first part lol,4
Frank Herbert would be proud to see a finally good dune movie,4

" @abhishekkerulkar2245  i agree with you.
Can you recommend some similar beena tune?",4
Very good. I liked.,4
The best line of this trailer is delivered by the flawless Florence Pugh. “What if Paul Atreides were still alive?” It’s such an honest horrified fear delivered in just 7 words. Because she knows exactly what the implications are if he is.,4
Idk how I got here but I love it,4
"Your father didn't believe In revenge

I agree bro so satisfying:,4
I wish my father was still alive for this series.,4
I’m a dune fan and I’m likening this set of movies so fair but wall the freemen may not know how to swim they know of swimming between their ancestors and legt’s father they would have knoll age of lakes rivers rain all of it they just don’t swim because it would contaminate the water reservoirs they had built,4
The Best 💯,4
Trailers going from quiet and calm to intense and loud is the perfect combo that makes people wanna see movies 🥸🤓(I think),4
It will easily be my favorite franchise,4

Funny thing. A movie about genocide nazimerica against nazis  saving them and sheltering them after the war not wanting communism bullshitting about freedom and the 8nly latino Alvarez in the movie never spoken of in history is being played by some a none hispanic asshole. Romanticism genocide and warpro white power. Isnt it pathetic?,4

" @wakeup958  Yes, but Oppenheimer wasn't part of the bombing. He was part of making the bomb. This is about Oppenheimer's life during the time period the bomb was created. This is why we don't see any World War 2 stuff. It isn't about World War 2. It's about Oppenheimer and he wasn't associated with many action situations as this is a real life story. But I get this is a different approach to a movie, but I 100% disagree more action being implemented would've been accurate.",4
its probably the best movie of last year. the castings were on point.,4

A great movie. One of the best and the most scary scenes was the Chevalier incident.,4
"Great movie, though putting music in every scene gives it three hour trailer vibes…",4
From one of my most anticipated movies of 2023 to best movie of 2023!,4
I love this song so much,4
"This music was created during the edo period, which was a peaceful time for Japan after sengoku or the waring period. The spring really resonates with me and I think of this music when I think of Japanese music. And as for culture wide, I'm a 外人but I have a deep knowledge",4
"I remember finding this as a kid back when I was doing heavy piano studies and from that found a channel called cre8ivemind or something of the sorts. It had a bunch of selected songs from different countries around the world, as well as world instruments. This video as well as others from around 12 years ago genuinely sparked my interests with instruments till this day 😭✨💖",4
"I speak very little Japanese, but I have a very good knowledge of the customs and etiquette of the country.",4
This music must be played at the Oscars when it has won all of 'em. All the 13 ♥️,4
"Oh! I heard this song before! Kara sang it in a short Detroit Become Human prequel(it's a game). I forgot the name of the video.

Beautiful.",4
Hauntingly beautiful !,4
Without doubt one of the most boring films I've seen in a long time.  I couldn't wait for it to end.  If you like watching 3 hours of dry senate testimony you might find this exciting.,4
"Good movie that illustrates well how after serving and giving the govt what they want and more, they dump you like yesterdays trash when they are finished with you.",4
Just saw this. Loved it,4
My great uncle ran and owned the boys school in los alamos before the government bought him out and the rest is history,4
"I watched it at movie theatre, this movie deserve each penny. Cinematic and camera effects are superb",4
Why is this piece of music not the National Anthem of Japan? Imagine during any International Sports Match this song is being played and everyone in the stadium getting goosebumps!😬😬😬 I wish it is really the national anthem of Japan.,4
Undoubtedly the best movie of 2023❤,4
Genshin Baal's theme :D,4
Oscar worthy from Thomas Shelby. Probably the most deserving Oscar in years if he wins it,4
The best movie of year,4

" @roquefortfiles  If you don't find Oppenheimer, McCarthyism or politics interesting, then I can see why those black and white scenes may have been boring to some people. But they were only like 10% of the movie. And extremely important to Oppenheimers story.",4
 @roquefortfiles  did you know the film was actually about oppenheimer? Not about the bomb?,4
I love baals,4
This film is proof positive to me that Nolan does not deserve all of the praise heaped on him.  Shooting this in Imax was a pointless waste of Imax cameras.  There was nothing in the script or visuals screaming for Imax.  If this was Lawrence of Arabia?  Sure.  Shooting 3 hours of essentially a senate hearing in Imax?  Why? And the bomb was a total dud.  Not impressed in the least.    @MATDMixes ,4
"Sakura represents transience. It inspired the theme song of the god of eternity in inazuma.

"so close ! It’s actually traditional Japanese music, hope this helps",4
This is historically accurate and based on a well respected book about Oppenheimer.,4
this is a masterpiece and you can't deny it,4

"I just saw this movie today. If you were hoping for a movie that adheres to the major character and plot points of Frank Herbert’s genius novel, prepare to be very disappointed! If you were hoping for a sweeping, briskly paced, action packed, science fiction epic that tells a thrilling story, then you will be very disappointed! 
If you were hoping for a darkly lit, “woke” commentary examining the perils of being a hero, the unfairness of colonialism and the use of the term, “Southern fundamentalists” till you want to beat your forehead against the wall, then this is the three hour torture session you have been yearning for.",4

"​ @jean-claudelol563  You can't lump every detail into a movie. The objective of an adaptation is to include as much detail from the source material as it's organically possible and without affecting the writing negatively. You'd have a rushed Marvel-esque Dune movie at your hands if you included everything A to Z in a 2 and a half hour movie. It's something that Lynch's Dune suffered from.
Baron's fetish is an unnecessary detail and doesn't pass in a pg-13 movie today. 
There is not much about the Harkonnens to show beyond their role in imperium politics and the erasure of house Atreides. Baron's nephews were literally two major characters in the second movie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
Have you even watched the second movie? Lady Jessica is literally the female lead of the second movie after Chani and her role in the movie is possibly the most crucial one considering she was the one who radicalized and manipulated the Fremen to rally them to Paul's cause
What I do agree on with you is that Dr Yueh and the Mentats were underdeveloped, I believe that too was a choice made to preserve the runtime since because there is simply no way you're getting a 3 hour movie that goes over every plot point and comes out good. It was necessary to keep the runtime short to garner the audience. Otherwise, Villeneuve shot about 4 to 6 hours of footage in part one alone and more than half the movie's original runtime which included several important scenes were cut in the post-production. While an extended cut will certainly elevate this adaptation the movies are still great. Much better than that Lynch version.",4

"it's hilarious how you take a book about the danger of religious fanaticism and twist it to exhonerate your religion and fit your agenda, as if the crusades didn't happen and as if the subjugation of the new world wasn't done in the name of the christian god. you shouldn't have to do that to enjoy a story man.",4
Yeah and it's one of my favorite artworks.,4
"yes it is a colour woodcut it's called ""神奈川沖浪"" witch means  ""the great wave of Kanagawa """,4

I just watched it in theaters and it was AMAZING. Our theater was vibrating with all the big sounds,4
masterpiece,4
I know art is subjective to what you find beautiful in each piece.  But I always thought with this piece you should look to the small wave in the foreground and how it looks about the same size as the mountain in the back.  Compare that to the giant wave that is the focus of the piece and I'd say the point was to demonstrate the raw power of the sea ... waves that can dwarf mountains can be a pretty haunting image,4
"Well, I've always thought there was a significance in the way the tips of waves look like grasping hands, perhaps the way the ocean takes back the land or takes away people sometimes.",4
One of the best movies I've watched since the hobbits,4
Warner Bros casting Case Oh as a worm is the best things that they've ever done,4
Who’s coming back after watching this masterpiece of a film?,4
One of the best trailer i saw in my life.,4

Dune just might as well be the greatest set of films of the decade 😮‍💨,4
Agreed! Your analogy is pretty spot on there.,4
We have something hope for! ‘ that’s not hope!’ You’re right that’s not hope at all,4
"I saw this film a few days ago.
TOTALLY AMAZING.",4
"With the clarity of this picture it certainly DOES look like they are all bowing to an enormous wave which will immediately crush them, with Mt. Fuji in the background of course.",4
Way better than part 1. Didn`t expect to be that good. Can`t wait for the 3`d.,4
XD Indeed.,4
" @RobynnexPaula  I was too excited on every part where things gonna change or happen from his visions , it has a great story not even a second got bored actually 
Have you watched dune:part one",4
shogun 2 :D !,4
Part 2 was better than the dune part 1. Watching this movie makes me thirsty and want to drink water !!!!,4
"Agree, they kept too much about how breathtaking it was 😂😂",4
Usually they don’t for the truly great movies,4
Totally agree. Absolute masterpiece.,4
Great movie to watch with family.,4
There is much anime in you search history? :) I don't get the same thing at all. :),4
"Oh my. It only figures that the traditional song used by Babymetal would be called ""Sakura"".
In any case, it's beautiful, never had heard it played on a Koto, only.",4
"The director said that Part 2 even works as a stand-allone (He made sure to explain what is important).
However, there are some character changes to swallow, so it may be good to get in the mood with Part 1 and already think about it a little",4
"I just read the book, and honestly the movie is even better than the book 😅 (at least Part 1). Which doesn't mean that the book is bad, but the movie as a format used the advantage it hat against written words, and really filled in the gaps and directed the focus.
Anyways, i still recommend the book, if you have time",4
Currently playing the game but I learned this song for classical guitar back in high school. I wish I still remembered it.,4
This will undoubtedly be the greatest epic film trilogy since Peter Jackson’s Lord of the rings.,4
"Dune Part 1, was the best sci fi movie I think I've ever seen when it comes to the story, the way it was filmed and just how entertaining it was. I haven't seen the original and refuse until I see the end of these new remakes. I'm looking forward to it, though.",4
"I just read the book and then watched the trailer Material. Dune Part 1 is 10/10 for me, but it really looks like Part 2 is also 10/10. However, it's going to be hard to accept some character changes, I think- at least that's a little hard for me in the book .",4
"I hope I’m wrong, but I have a feeling this won’t be as good as part one.",4
"I am beyond ecstatic for Dune 2. I haven't been this excited for a movie, let a lone a trilogy, in a VERY long time!",4
I just finished watching Part One and it was a masterpiece. Can't wait for this,4

I love Feyds reaction to it😂😂 his face going “damn bro!”,4
Just watched the movie. Really great movie.,4
"I wish there’ll be Part 3, Part 2 is too short!! We want more!!",4
"A good continuing to the first episode and i enjoyed when the traitors was eating desert sand. Now, we wait for the third episode.",4

Great movie to watch with family.,4
Happy to be a part of this incredible Trilogy <3,4
 @cakertaker_1013  that movie is already beautifully and uniquely animated that perfectly captures the traditional Japanese paintings. Not sure why it needs to be made in 3d,4

"""May thy knife chip and shatter.."", that's a cool line. Hope that makes the reel.",4
Disney will never do a Japanese princess cuz they'll have to do actual research and can't whitewash it like other Asian stories like Mulan and Raya lmao. Big Hero was a pass cuz it was a what if world if Japan won the war,4
"Watch it in cinema, Good lord its divine af",4
I can’t wait this is so exciting,4
I don't know but is a little bit chaotic.. Looks like this film wanted to copy the Marvel style 😅,4
​ @TN-ju4ro  TRUE FOR SURE,4

I  wonder if Shaddap Mapes will put in an appearance?  Linda Hunt was great in the part in the 1984 Dune.,4
"It seems to be at the level of Mozarts music, was this created with modern western harmony or is it entirely a product of japanese culture?",4
" @tefky7964  thanks, looks like I'm going tomorrow then",4
There is much more action. It kind of seems like they tried to make as many badass scenes for Paul as possible and all of them are great.,4
"Very nice effects, it felt like sand filled my mouth 😄",4
First one was impressive. Let’s see second and get charmed again and again,4

Best mis-click of my life.,4
"Playing as Sweden in Civ 6, got this as a great work of music yesterday",4
It looks like my score for the movie will be 10/10. It fits my criteria. It's a very successful work.,4
So good. Watched it yesterday and I'll likely watch it one kr two times more in the coming weeks. Excellent.,4
Great Japan Song✨✨❤️✨✨❤️🍁🍁🍱🍙🍤🍥⛩💌🇯🇵,4
Just watched this in cinema and it's an amazing experience!!!! 10/10,4
 @maazahmed506  I would love an extended cut. Maybe they’ll consider it after the release of Dune Messiah. Maybe after the theatrical versions have already released as a box set. It would be nice if Denis opened up to the idea of giving the fans a final/directors cut release. I won’t be holding my breath though.,4
I just seen it you have to watch at the cinema especially to enjoy how huge the machines are,4
 @ShubhTheOcean  yeah I’d definitely recommend watching the first movie beforehand,4
 @ShubhTheOcean Yes. I would highly recommend it.,4
" @caesaraugustus4563  yes, better than movies",4
"the sound was amazing, and the scenes made us feel small . Breathtaking",4
Decline To state if you look up koto Japanese beats you can find some rap beats but just instrumentals. If you do some research on rap songs with traditional Japanese imagery or instrumentation you might find one :),4
I think it’s gonna be even better than the second if WE JUST LET DENIS COOK. This man will not disappoint and I know it.,4
one of the best movie ever,4
yes anthony paul it will be so incredibly sick and awesome and cool u should watch it Wit hme :DDDDD !!!,4
Abbie Aileen yes it sure is!,4
What a movie to watch! Ive love it,4
 @adamturner9932 great insight bud,4
I hate hype too because it is always bait and switch. But this one not only lives up to the hype but goes beyond. It's been YEARS since I've watched a movie of this caliber. I was giving up hope that all movies are garbage from here on out. But this movie is really a game changer. Epic is an understatement.,4
"Every time I listen to this, I’m like so proud to be Japanese. 🇯🇵🎌",4
"Folks folks folks, easily the best movie Ives seen in last 5 years.",4
Ion get this movie but it’s awesome,4
"Its really great to return back to this trailer after watching the movie, waiting truly paid off, pretty much everywhere it has over 90%, somewhere even 95%. I really hope that there will be 3rd part (its kind of confirmed, but there can always something go wrong...).",4
I can see where ff music is from :),4
Hands down one of the best movies I've seen since Blade Runner 2049.,4
"I am looking for a Kabuki song where the dude says something, then the creepy woman/girl says ""hai hai"", then the guy says something again, and she continues with ""hai hai"", and it goes on for a while like this. 
The woman/girl also says something before OR after the ""hai hai"" 

Or maybe she doesn't. 

What song is that? 


Thanks.",4
Same... feels like the trailer didn't do it justice. That's a first for me. Usually the trailer is better than the movie. Ha.,4
what a beautiful painting!!,4
"Ar first sure... But I felt hope, drive and fulfillment at the coming of the messiah in the movie. Movie was... just... Epic. I'm still feeling movie.",4

like 2000 years ago :D,4
A masterpiece.,4
Akshey Kumar is the best 🔥,4
It's basically a storyline for a series of video games made in to a movie and I think that's awesome.,4
One of the best trailers I’ve ever seen.,4
Awesome film,4
Watched movie  twice Best VFX in Bollywood film ever. 👍,4
One of the best trailers ever,4
"4 years later, I still rewatch this masterpiece",4

One of the greatest movie trailers ever just for the movie to be complete utter garbage 😔,4
"Bollywood version of Naruto Shippuden, Great Visuals Work.",4
Absolute masterpiece.,4
I wish this movie was as dark as the original trilogy. Too much comedy.,4
for the part that looks promising and letdown you should have picked a better example,4
"Am a fan of all Matrix movies, liked this one especially. Was a rehearsal of all previous movies adn they did it so well. You wont understand this part, if you did not see the previous 3 movies 5x each.. Till then, you are not prepared to watch the number 4.",4
Mst movie hai maine dekha liya bhut achi h ab tak ki sabse best movie,4
2:18 masterpiece scene,4
The trailer was deceiving—proof you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. What looked promising ended up being a huge letdown!!,4

That's perfectly okay,4
​ @itsjoeyy3437  yeah best movie ever.👍,4
This masterpiece was heavily inspired by the killing joke and dark Knight returns. Very accurate,4
First movie on which I wasted my time 3rd class acting same old story and so long scenes make it boring. Really Bollywood you want to revive with such movies. The only good thing about movie was SRK and south sir💞. But no cinema can revive with VFX untill there is good acting scenes and direction,4
Today i watch this film. Omg omg just outstanding. And just waiiting for part 2. When part 2 Comeing,4
"I just watch this movie 🎥

Mouni roy nailed it❤she is irreplaceable we need her in part 2! Just loved her performance as villan,4
"Anyone who’s watched the entire Harry Potter series can easily tell that this movie takes a lot of inspiration from it, instead of coming up with its own original idea.",4

" @itsnotthatbad2282  everyone wanted joker they all ignored Arthur like in the movie,Lee represents us forcing him to be joker,and in the end when there is no joker,the fans who were expecting something crazy to happen in the court scene like us the audience walk out of the court disappointed like in the real life people are disappointed by the movie that joker was backtracked to Arthur,but there are still some people who like Arthur which is signified by the fans who tried to save him in the car saying they still love him",4
It's not bad but destroys the first movie I think if you love the first one you will hate the sequel,4
I thought I was the only one who watches the trailer and imagine what this movie should have been.  The song made the trailer feel like this movie should have  been awesome 😂😂😂,4
There were Trinitys made but who keeps them more happy for reason known signorney weaver and geena davis,4
"Leaving a comment after reading all the review of Joker 2, i wont watch it obviously since i love Joker, really goof movie",4
"Here to remember the hype, and then the movie actually being good. That was nice, wasn't it?",4
Superb Back to Bollywood,4
"The film was even worse than the trailer. Thanks for the consistent, steep decline since the original masterpiece.",4
Came back to this masterpiece after watching that god-awful sequel.,4
" @EternalKvK  The first and second movie are phenomenal, third and fourth I would say are pretty mid. All of them were enjoyable to watch imo",4
You got the joke lol,4
Brahmastra part one shiva movie blockbuster my favorite,4
"I've been thinking about #JokerFolieADeux all day. It's a film that lingers in your mind long after the credits roll. The chemistry between Joaquin Phoenix and Lady Gaga is electric, and their characters are so complex and compelling. The film's exploration of mental illness is both sensitive and unflinching, and it raises important questions about society's treatment of those who are different. If you're a fan of psychological thrillers or character-driven dramas, this is a film you absolutely cannot miss.",4
Mind blowing movie loved it and eager to watch part 2 dev🔥🔥,4
The funny moments is this movie was directed and script written by original matrix 1999 director,4

The movie is trash. The trailer is a masterpiece.,4
"And it was a pretty good one at that, which is why I don't view the sequel as canon",4
Fair point. If you can explain why in further detail it would be great.,4
Ye awesome movie comments vale shyd distributors honge🤣,4

"The couple that made life a bit more magical , i just watched it again after all this time the matrix is still my number one and to have them reincarnated or a miracle resurrection gave some closure to the movie .    paint the rainbows , I'll see you in the real world when you're done.",4

best comment 🤞,4
Don't care what anyone says I still love every movie in this series. The only scene that I would've changed in this movie was The Merovingian scene..he shouldn't have been included if he was just meant to yell...waste...other than that I loved it.,4
Same. I come back to imagine how I felt before the movie came out. Wish they did a good movie,4
By far better VFX than adipurush. It will finally be Appreciated in brahmastra part 2,4

It's 2023 and it's still a masterpiece! It never goes out of style,4
"I think the overall narration had to be improved. It's like you are showing larger than life VFX and graphics but even the talented actors you had looked clueless,were childish and lacked intensity. I don't know it was a issue a character writing or direction",4
Yep pretty much,4
"yes you are right
they are going to take 3 years because they made 40% film already like bahubali 2 shooting",4
 @ironspidey7137  ok my point is that brahmastra part 2: dev should be 10x better than part 1 whether we have to wait for a long time .,4

" @rebelscum2604  I am born in 76 lol. I saw all Matrix in movie theatres. I remember the backlash after Reloaded (which still became one of the most successful R-rated movie ever) and how Revolution struggled at the box office for that reason. Revolutions imho has not really been reevaluated lately. I cannot speak for everyone else but in your answer you said  ""it will grow on you"" therefore I was answering to this - not a chance it will grown on me, personally, because I loved the trilogy from its release in cinemas.",4
best opinion fr the vfx and graphics were cool the story i mean.... they didnt even introduce the story properly plus its a flop i mean,4
"@Dancing Thumb 👑 Even I can understand hindi but he is using some god level language.He claims Hollywood movies like Batman VFX was done in Jodhpur,INDIA and biggest VFX company of world is in bengluru.",4

" @Jonathan-be7gj  dune,interstellar,inception, dark knight rises,etc is done by DNEG which is an indin company and many of there post production is done in banglore office. Dont doubt our engineers or vfx artist . red chilies is prime example RAone, Zero ,etc perfection",4

Best of drama movie ever i hope to continue to new parts,4
It's films like this and the dark Knight trilogy and man of steel that make me think there's still hope for DC. So much potential.,4
Best movie character of all time,4
"That woman is actually so dumb tho ""will you please stop bothering my kid"" oh yes, a common sign of being bothered is being happy, smiling, and laughing having fun. Judgemental bi.tch",4
This was a god tier trailer I actually love it,4
It is one of the most awesome,4
"That dev character and amrita character is actually deepika and ranveer, Hope Ranveer's Dev character will be like alauddin khilji from Padmaavat movie",4
the trailer did not do it justice......this was the best movie ive seen in a very long time,4
"Guys I figured out why Agnidev aka Brahmadev was in subconscious stage for so many years and why he lost to Amrita despite being so much powerful and possessing both the powers of Agni and Jal along with certain other powers. Brahmadev didn't lost to Amrita, he lost to his love, fiance Amrita, and that was intentional. Only loophole of all his powers he got is LOVE. That's why even when Brahmastra was about to destroy the universe, innocent love of Shiva and Isha made their way to survival. My theory is when Dev aka Brahmadev got all the powers and about to destroy the world, sages conspired against him by letting Amrita go and fight against him. Sages knew the only loophole of Brahmadev. See you people on 2025.",4
Movie really nice but this heroine not match for this movie,4
Masterpiece!,4
This is a masterpiece,4

"They never kiss in the actual movie, do they? I watched it on disney plus, must have missed teh kiss scene if there is one. Great movie, over the top, but all the hugging feels a bit weird. LOL She friendzoned him. If there is a kiss in the movie does anyone have the time in the movie?",4

Why joker is a success and other dc films are not is because joker is the most relatable character to real life ever in a superhero film,4
This trailer is an art. Just like the film. The ending while he was getting ready for the show was epic,4
"Who knew that the Joker would be more relatable than Batman. The way  they took a supervillain and made him an absolute hero. Read ""masterpiece"" in the comment before watching it and I couldn't agree more...message: Be nice to others, you don't know the discomfort of the shoes they walk in.",4
Apart from cringe love scenes movie is good,4

" @tvushington6994  how can u say it's a cheap knockoff? Bruh 💀 this whole trilogy took 10 years in making and btw south only started uplifting after Bahubali. Before that it has more cringe movies . Same storyline where a hero comes helps poor people , hes a one many army and much more drama. 
Seriously this guy comparing Bollywood with south Indian movies only bcuz of some rrr, kantara, bahubali and kgf movies 😂 dude listen we all grew up watching Bollywood movies and even if not there's not a time u haven't seen any bolly thing from ur birth. Atleast respect what the tried to do. Tumhara south wala adipurush ka dikh hi raha hai haal",4
Underrated?? My man most people love this movie tf u mean,4

I’m 1 hour into this movie…. I wanna see it all… hope there will be a good finish.,4
It's been 2 years since this movie premiered and Joaquin's performance makes me chill. He really deserved that Oscar for Best Actor.,4
 @user-lehsun-le-garib  I finished it last night. I liked it. It was fun… not a top 10 for me but pretty decent film.,4
I was enthralled by this film. It was a great origin story.,4
"This was a filming masterpiece, that a genre never knew it could produce. 10/10/10",4
When he wanted to cry a laugh emerged out instead what I love is in this is how he was formed into the villain because of everyone else not the opposite fun fact Heath ledger was such a good actor and played joker so well some of the crew were a bit nervous to film him,4
"just watched this last night, and its one of the best films i've seen recently, on par with Marvel movies. India/Bollywood is doing it",4
One of the best films ever made.,4
Masterpiece,4

 @myntraankit3889  in 1st part 80% part cover love story but 2nd part saved my money bro 2nd part was full of goosebumps,4
Heath Ledger and Joaquin Phoenix making it harder for future actors to play Joker. The only one who will and should be able to play is Willem Dafoe,4
"Seen it hundreds of times, best movie",4
"Best movie of the decade, century, all time ❤️",4
They should list this movie as a COMEDY!!!,4

Sab sa best movies,4
how did todd make the hangover and then this masterpiece,4
@CLB Ronin well technically the director could make bruce wayne get adult enough in the movie just like the other batman(1989) and the dark knight(2008). imagine Joaquin Phoenix as a joker and Robert Pattinson as a batman In the movie called.. you name it.,4
This movie  is so underrated !!! Its the best movie of year....Ranbir rocks..,4
this trailer still feels like a garbage just like the movie,4
"I can't help myself, but I have a strange feeling that original idea was about rebooted trilogy. Producers then chickened out a mashed all three movies into one. Please tell me I am not only one with this feeling.",4

Best movie in Warner brother studios,4
@ Well if there is a new movie or trilogy coming its too late. Nobody cares about this anymore. Its over its done.,4
"aaj dekhi jake....bas ek do hi jagah lagi hai ab ...and so glad i watched it... what a brilliant spectacle, and the theme that love is the greatest power of all...the goosebump moments  when the astras r introduced, the chase scene in cars on the hill road... damn i almost missed it becoz of the bad reviews...ye youtubers, influencers they just want to milk public sentiment for views. jisne negative reviews ke karan miss kar di, main kahunga dekh aao 3d me...fir nahii milegi, aur ott me experience 30% rahega. ye laptop pe dekhne wali picture nahi hai. it needs that loud surround music and 3d.",4
People who are trolling it for it’s story will relize what a masterpiece BRAHMASTRA is when it will complete its trilogy.....Besr wishes for team....bring itsoon✌🏻✌🏻,4
" @Golden_Fox_Gaming  Yeah, I finally seen it.  I ordered it on DVD and while it was a good idea for a story, I felt it was poorly written and acted.  I am happy my DVD had an error on it and I returned it for a refund.",4

"I am one in a 1000 people that loved the movie for the most part. NO, I didn''t react with anger when Fishburne wasn't going to be the movie. I simply embraced the direction the directors went in. It's a sequel and casting changes in many movies, not just this one. I just wanted a GOOD MOVIE, I didn't care so much who was and wasn't in it
The first 1/2 hour was confusing and slow. After that I really loved everything in the movie. Esp how they continued the story of the machines and humans!! It really had detph and it was wonderful to see that some of the machines did decide to coexist with humans.
No, I had zero problem with Neal Patrick Harris being in this movie. He did an AWESOME job and I did like the new version of Smith. And the ending...the link between Neo and Trinity meant she becomes HIS EQUAL? DAAMN I didn't see that coming
But most people just fixated on Fishburne not being in the movie and the slow start. 
I've always been a very indepent thinker and 'go against the grain' quite often.
The Wachowski sisters did a movie THEY wanted to make and I feel they felt no compulsion to please OG matrix fans. That's their right and it's the fans right to be pissed. I'm just glad a new matrix was made at all!
I do understand the legitimate beefs people had. You can hate the movie. I loved it and hope they make a sequel one day...but with the mass reactions I doubt it will ever happen.",4

"You're right, the portrayal of scientists in cinema can be problematic. The ""evil scientist"" trope and the easy demise of good-guy scientists perpetuate harmful stereotypes and misunderstandings about STEM fields. Here's a breakdown of the issue and some alternative perspectives:

The Problematic Tropes:

Evil Scientist: This trope portrays scientists as power-hungry individuals driven by personal gain, often resorting to unethical experiments and endangering others. It reinforces negative stereotypes about scientific research and discourages young people from pursuing STEM careers.

Doomed Scientist: This trope shows scientists, even good ones, falling victim to villains or their own experiments. It undermines the valuable contributions of scientists and reinforces the misconception that STEM fields are inherently dangerous or perilous.

Reasons for These Tropes:

Dramatic Conflict: These tropes are often used to create dramatic tension and conflict in movies. The ""evil scientist"" provides a clear antagonist, while the death of a scientist can raise the stakes and evoke emotional responses.

Lack of Scientific Accuracy: Many movies prioritize entertainment over scientific accuracy. This can lead to misrepresentations of scientific processes and characters that don't reflect the reality of the field.

Alternative Perspectives:

Diversity of Scientists: We need to see scientists of all genders, ethnicities, and backgrounds represented in movies. This will challenge stereotypes and encourage more people to consider careers in STEM.

Focus on the Positive: Movies can showcase the positive impact of scientific research on society. Showing scientists working to solve real-world problems, like climate change or disease, can inspire young people to get involved.

Humanizing Scientists: Scientists are not just lab coats and formulas. They are people with hopes, dreams, and flaws. Movies can portray them as relatable characters who face challenges and overcome obstacles.

Moving Forward:

It's important to be critical of how scientists are portrayed in movies and advocate for more accurate and diverse representation. By challenging these harmful tropes, we can encourage a more positive and realistic understanding of STEM fields and inspire the next generation of scientists.

I hope this analysis provides a helpful perspective on this issue. Remember, movies are powerful tools that can shape our perceptions of the world. Let's encourage filmmakers to portray scientists in a way that is accurate, inspiring, and reflects the true diversity and importance of these fields.",4
The greatest movie of all time,4
Nice movie but most of the power story line are so similar to marvel 😅,4

"The Matrix is the Greatest Near-Future Sci-Fi Movie Series of all time. There's so much room for expansion on the universe and further development too, more Movies, more TV Shows, another Animatrix etc",4
"Maybe Abaddon, the counterpart of Satan could be thinking deep by now of the mistakes committed by Satan in his failed system and programs that if he do the same thing like what Satan does in slowing down everything like a turtle his version of system and program could be at risk for quick disposal for the garbage collectors to collect. That is if he can have the time and chance to formulate a program and system of his own if he can manage to beat Satan's forces, if not his locust army will be turned like locust insects and be eaten by the liquor drinkers who loves to eat locusts as ""pulutan "" in drinking sessions of the alcoholics synonymous.",4

Brhmastra is a good movie & best vfx ❤❤,4
this movie is an absolutely astonishing masterpiece,4
Ekdam Bakwaz Movie 🤣😛 Guruji was on run worried 😯 about safety but suddenly the Romeo Juliet decided to play 🎆 fireworks. No  good story except fluid effects of VFX. Long time wasted just to play with fire expectram and song with it. Most of the time were spent just on commentary of the story rather than making a movie on that story. As if we are hearing story rather than watching it. Just adding great actors and childish VFX doesn't turn a useless story into a movie.,4
The. Best. DC. Movie. Period.,4
Masterpiece,4
1:50 he looks so brave,4
Great movie,4
We need movies like BHRAMASTRA not like ADIPURUSH,4

"Ch£tiye jab srk  ne swades , dear zindagi & fan - raees also good jesi film ki thi tabh toh there jese theater nhi Jate hence flop",4
This is a stand-alone film. It has no relation to Bhool Bhuliyaa-1. It is perfect combination of horror and comedy element. It is a perfect family entertainer.,4
so far this is the best 2023 movie.,4
"This movie was an average movie, but the first one was a masterpiece",4

 Keanu Reeves  thank you keannu very cool,4
Masterpiece ❤🎉,4
This is movie was not that bad as people say. This movie was clearly not made for masses,4
"I remember the good old days when, to watch the end of the story,  you would have had to go through one, maybe two sequels. Today, the series goes on and on, up to four or more that, at some point, you forget when and why the story started. With John Wick, I've got bored after the second part, seems that, the hero had endless resources of physical and mental resources (not to mention luck, guns and ammo) and the armies of top assassins sent to eliminate him will always fail, individual and collective. What could possible challenge him? John Wick against Predator? Against Tanos? I had to go through another two sequels for what? John Wick dies and goes next to his wife? He could have spared himself (and us) of all the trouble by putting a bullet in his head, ad least he would not have died tired. And Winston? After all this fuss, took his hotel back and the life of assassin's host right from where he left it? So, if he will have another brush with High Table,  can start all over again? I am sorry, but, the world that we live in today is beyond my comprehension. Ad least the movie world.",4
Best movie in 2022,4
Best ❤❤❤❤,4
Baaba is best Vijay setupati 🔥👍🔱🔱,4
Better than any marvel and DC movie,4
No other action movie will ever top this ...unless the movie is called john wick 5 fucking masterpiece from start to finish keanu is forever a fucking legend,4

The movie is surprisingly good if you're not just expecting a carbon copy of the original.,4

"Totaly not realistic movie , shame it is  not what inexpected . Blind guy avoiding all bullets lol",4
Love how they integrated a kids song and made my hairs stand sheesh 🔥🔥🔥,4
"I don't think any movie series demonstrates style over substance like the Wick franchise. The first one was a lot of fun and well done. After that it's just been highly stylized ultra choreographed fight scenes that find new ways to kill people. JW4 takes that yet another level with axes, arrows, bladed of all kinds, incendiary rounds, etc, etc. There's literally no plot other than same plot, he has to work his way up the food chain of bad guys to be free.

Some of the visuals are outstanding and entertaining, some were clunky and some poor CGI showed itself. I found the blind swordsmen trope ruined by this movie, and the need for the suspension of disbelief turned to max to keep watching it. From all that you'd think I didn't like this movie.

In the genre of mindless ultra violent fun over the top fight scenes, it's a good movie. Fans of the franchise will not be disappointed. I'm over those kinda of movies at this point and I think in the genre of utterly over the top ultra violent movies with great (and I do mean great!) amazing fight scenes, yet has humor, character development, etc, done for a fraction of the cost, Hardcore Henry is my pick.

As to John Wick 4, seen one you seen 'em all but those who like the franchise: A-",4
Bhool bhulaiayaa 2 is best,4

Love from India .Hinduism also has the similar concept as shown in the matrix series called Maya. Just telling nit saying the film has copied the concept,4
"The production didn't even bother to bring back the iconic Matrix sunglasses, AND they did not even bother having Keanu cut his hair to look half as sharp as he did before...

Nice trailer though, the music sounds 'original', reminds of Quentin Tarantino's sarcasm in his movies ! 

Multi-million profits aside, do you think the producers and lead casts think the Original Classic really needs a rundown ""upgrade"" rehash?  Nah, most likely Not and they shouldn't have.",4
The trailer sure fooled me! Thought this was going to be the best Matrix….,4
I think Akshay Kumar is the best for Bhool Bhulaiya 2,4
“Namaste Scientists sahab” - that dialogue 😂😂😂 wtf.. should have been different.. by the way SRK is best in this movie 🍿,4

Trailer is good but the movie fantastic,4
I'm glad head shots are against the rules or this would have been a short movie! Lol,4
Akshay Kumar is best ❤,4
"The movie is ...ok -> good. Nothing lacks on the visual. Maybe someone will say that it is because we all know what to expect, and I am not against you. 
For me, it is the level of being polished. The first movies and especially the first one was much more raw.... unfiltered if you like. Modern movies got more of this ""Disney Filter"" and it does not suit this movie.",4

Best movie of India..❤🎉,4
"The matrix 4 would have been a lot better if they would have reinserted Ne-Yo back into the matrix as Keanu Reeves, and instead of actually being the one, he thought he was an actor, and didn’t believe that the events in the movie actually took place in real life. That would’ve explained why he looked like John wick",4
 @superstaras9445  ok thanks for informing me. But full movie chahiye. Surety de rahe ho to ki full movie ayega??,4
Facts: Matrix was created and everything by Keanu!! And The wanna be trinity betrayal is like chilidrina del Chaco del ocho that stole the personification and history story of chilidrina that trinity stole it too! The director wanna be stole it too! Current one! But it’s actually keanus matrix! Facts: Truth Shalom Aleichem,4
Out of the 4 films this was definitely the best one,4

"I wouldn’t say the series got better & better. The 1st one is great & this 4th installment is excellent.  2nd & 3rd are good, but not as engaging.",4
Haaa bhai best hai ye,4
I love this movie,4
Best Wick of all time,4
Some of the best world building of any movie series,4
Great movie,4
Jawan trailer not only in You Tube release Jawan also released in Shahrukh Khan's Instagram and got more views and likes than you tube OK Gandu Brother...,4
Movie 3 wali best,4
Masterpiece ❤,4
Awesome movie h guys,4
"Hello 👋 greetings, nice to meet you how are you doing?",4
"Such wasted potential. This would have been the ultimate chance to capitalize on all the meta culture that’s been going around. Easy movie idea: Neo is no longer the one, but he witnesses a new one emerge and as he witnesses similar events, tries to mentor the new one in the right direction. Give us our hero in a new stage of life; learning to become a teacher. (Instead of resetting the character)",4
Mashallah nice movie good play roll srk,4
Love from Bangladesh  everybody ❤❤,4
Best action 😮,4
Unpopular opinion here but I thought the movie was very good and was more psychological than the last 3 movies. I know it didn't have the action of the previous films but it was well put together in my opinion.,4
The films are average and derivative at best. The only other issue is Reeves himself. He can't act for sh*t. Never could. Never will.,4
I’d love to see a series how John wick became the Baba Yaga,4
Thank you! People still don't get it and they actually happy to getting another movie without it's creators.,4
best movie❤❤❤❤❤,4
" @JohnBarron-n I’d say it’s the best Matrix sequel. You can’t beat the OG, but I still really like 4",4
"Best movie ever, Taare Zameen par!!",4
i love John,4
Great movie,4
this looks fucking awesome,4
"Loved all of the Matrix movies and have watched them several times over the years. Having said that, this movie sucked. I'm honestly surprised Keanu Reeves agreed to star in it.",4
"Haha Warriors rip off, this is the first film I have watched that has paid homage to the great Warriors film from the 1970's.",4
Bhool bhuliya 1 is the best ❤,4
"Ha ha ha 














No",4
This was entirely Lana Wachowski point WB was going to make a sequel with or with out her and pretty much forced her to make it. So she made fun of them the entire movie and intentionally torpedoed this franchise. So WB couldn't make any more Matrix movies this stopped WB giving another director credit for her work. The amount of meta in this movie its a joke film like Starving Games. Wachowski never wanted us to take it seriously. That is obvious after the opening scene.,4
Love the remix actually 😅,4
Nah really this definitely was released in like 1007😂😂😂😂,4
"You and I left a good life behind a long time ago, my friend. I said, to the Sumerian.",4
By far one of the best action movies 💯❣️,4
"Bhool bhulaiya 2 zbrdst movie🔥🔥🔥🔥

 @mancunian5617  Thanks for ur kind information,4
#Jawan Worldwide Collection 1132 CRORE🎉🎉❤❤ CONGRATULATIONS,4
"Not the same withouth Lorens Fishburne and Hugo Weaving as agent Smith.they gave some special charm to the movie along with Keanu of course....by the Wayne,Keanu seems like a very nice guy,you just see that in his face.humble guy but succesful.thats a rare combination....",4
A huge let down from part 1 2 and 3. I get the impression of a desperate man fighting to save his skin rather than a doting father fighting for the memory of his wife. Action sequence sloppy with too many scissors take downs and no original action sequences. Mediocre at best.,4
I love Keane the films good  but to much like warriors etc.. shame its the last one. But good film.,4
Oooh exciting!!!,4
I really love this Trailer!,4
​ @realguru1725 Ha bsdk Vijay thalapathy ke Instagram likes dekh ke aa gandu sirf photo ka😂,4
"Loved it, Classic Movie 9/10...no doubt john wick is the best action movie franchise!",4
"John Wick 4 feels like watching a video game😂🤦‍♂️
He just cant die no matter how😜",4
" Keanu Reeves  thank you so much ,thats great",4
Same here! It's infectious and brilliant!,4

Omg I love this song so be like everyone,4
​ @abcabc-fgh7sn 😂 we north audience do not consume shit. We only support gòod movies,4
"Lol, is that a scarlett witch😂,,,,,should have mentioned inspired from mcu",4
The formula for this movie is really simple. I want to be somewhat afraid of the Matrix itself. This movie didn’t provide that. Nobody wants to see old people on the screen. There’s an old lady that was on the screen that had way too much air time. I can’t remember or quote anything she said. Get rid of CGI unless really needed. People want action thats what they would like to see in a movie like this. It didn’t deliver. Put both the first and this movie on at the same time and I guarantee your eyes would be glued to the first movie. That’s the real test of any sequel.,4
Masterpiece ❤,4
"Spoiler John dies at the end but what died is the name and the idea of John wick 
The reason people talk about a John wick 5 is we didn't see him being buried
He might be alive and live a normal life now that he is free through another name but baba Yaya might still be alive in a way",4
Lance Reddick. I salute you dear sir! Rest in peace.,4
You have to release this movie in China..  may be theyll love it,4
Srk love you ❤,4
Best trailer.,4
great,4
"Your entir channel is dedicated to being a contrarian. 
Hollywood “died” years ago in your brain: don’t act like you ever thought otherwise",4
I loved this movie SO much!!!❤🥰😍,4
"I sort of dig the premise that the system just appropriated the ""rebellion"" and made it part of itself. Sort of like corporate wokeism, or the LGBT friendly military that is bombing children.",4
"Never😂
Kartik one and only hero!
He is growing🎉
His bb3 will be a super hit film🎉
Old mans cant give entertain like kartik🤙",4
What a masterpiece!,4
This CGI is better than marvel and dc,4
The film is the best,4
When the trailer is a thousand times better than the movie.  A woke Matrix. lol.,4
love this movie,4
Great movie. Watched already.,4
"This was easily better than 2 or 3. By a mile.
As for who came up with the story? Yeah, that would be Larry Wachowaki. You know, the director, writer of all of them?",4
" @the_instru  Sorry, I should have been clearer. Go watch an old cult flick called The Warriors. It's a Walter Hill show circa 1979??? A great watch at a drive-in theatre. Then you will understand what I am saying....",4
Yes the true King of India is back to regain his lost empire. This is truly history,4
Please let this be as good as I want it to be.,4

"Yes it is, kids will absolutely love it, and there's no foul language in the movie, so that's a plus.",4
"I knew I recognized the actor who portrayed Killa, I just couldn't put my finger on it. Of course, it is Scott Adkins in a fat suit! And Dolls from Wynonna Earp is Mr. Nobody. (No connection to Nobody of Bob Odenkirk?)
I love the movie, especially the places for the fight scenes. It was like a video game.",4
I wonder why John Wick isn't in Marvel series yet...? I mean with such an amazing 'super powers'...,4
Music outstanding,4
"The director of extraction , should be the next , john wick 5 … action was awesome",4
Tabu mam's acting was superb 👍👍👍,4
Indians made Lord of the Rings movie with Baahubali and now a Marvel movie with this. Lol.,4
a man has to look his best when it's time to get married or buried 💀,4
"Oh yeah this is about the matrix. Of course I never saw the new one, but I saw the trilogy and the Animatrix and yeah I’m not agent Smith per se I’m not werewolves and vampires per se. I’m certainly not the Merovingian per se, but I’m neo per se to paraphrase.",4
Masterpiece ❤🎉,4
I watched John wick last night and all I can say it was amazing movie but like we say every beginning has an end ❤😢,4
Masterpiece ❤,4
It's really amazing in bollywood industry 🔥🔥🔥🔥,4

Such a sweet fan ✌️❤️🤟,4
"Still the absolute best trailer ever for a movie that just wasn't all that great, the team that made this should make all trailers ever, unbelievable talent here",4

Funny how the trailer was better than the actual movie….,4
"I don't like hero but hritik roshan is best super hero of all time but hritik roshan is busy in making krrish 3 n ramayana so Ranbir Kapoor is not good at all !! , om namah shivaye 🙏🕉",4
The cinematography in this movie is some of the best in the series! 💯👍👍,4
"I can see the matrix I can read the code. Does that make me crazy? I suppose it does. It’s just binary semantics in the Digit here there and symbols. If you get the symbols in the cryptography and the cryptology and the ATS 256 encryption, then you can figure out the matrix and then if you take out your contacts and have ocular desensitization then you know how easy to matrixes to manipulate but it’s all part of the algorithm the AI does it it all makes sense. I love YouTube.",4
Wow so cool,4
This is and always will be the best action franchise ever,4
The best,4
John wick 4 was a masterpiece 🎉,4
"This movie was all up to my expectations but it’s honestly still a pretty good movie there were parts of the movie that felt completely unnecessary and some weird and dumb scenes but All in all this was an alright movie 7.1/10

Edit:comeback released this movie was even worse 3.2/10",4
 @FilmSpook  he is way much better than the original one,4

Thanks for your love and concern where are you from.,4
"This trailer is the best thing about the movie, all thanks to the song.",4
john wick from Bollywood better Kolliwood i hope,4
Love John wick movies.. been waiting for #4❤,4
"Too late, get over it. It doesn't ruin the first three films. Just don't worry about Matrix 4. Only Matrix 1 was really great (and the Wachowskis had copied much of the story from other writers, this is a fact). Parts 2 and 3 were just okay, with a few cool scenes, but didn't quite have the unique feel of the first film.",4
Best film in the franchise period 777,4
"I miss the adjudicator. They did the fantastic job, I hoped if they could return in the next installment of the series 😅",4

Very violent but very energetic inducting mature viewers should apply: Recommend.*,4
LMAO at the people who were duped by the trailers (aka propaganda) into thinking this was going to be a good movie.,4
Just watched John Wick 4 today and the only thing I can say is Its the best movie ever made.❤,4

"​ @mattdayman9632 
Ditto That 👍 I am now 75 years young and I loved the original movie and when I took my niece to the theater to see it, she walked out! I asked why she, and she replied, ""It's nonsense,!"" I replied, ""It is just a movie 🎥!""

I was also disappointed with this last one, whoever when she caught him at the End, I understood the setup of the director, and Why Trinity had to play that part!",4
1 year of this masterpiece,4

"This film is a towering achievement. I can't think of another series that gets better with each film -- they have seemingly done the impossible. ""If it is possible, we have done it. If it is impossible, we will do it."" -- One of Caesar's favorite Generals' Maxims",4

it is a really good trailer. If only the movie was as good,4
"It's better to start from the first movie up to the 3rd one. Not only there's so many references from the prequels, but also wathing the prequels will give you a better understanding on what's going on in the movie.",4
Here we go again John wick 4 is the best movie ever they worked hard harder than a bunch of action movie si don’t understand HOW DO YOU NOT LIKE A ACTION MOVIES THAT PERFECT,4
Sorry but the firsr one is a masterpiece we can't compare this to akshay acting and era,4
Honestly this movie is so shitty I’m sorry to say. I love Keanu but it’s just full of mindless action scenes that aren’t even that great. I watched it after reading a bunch of comments about how good it was and was super disappointed. It was like force feeding myself food that has horrible flavor.,4

"The odds of someone seeing this at this point are low, but is there a version of the OST with that metal clacking like at 0:33 and 2:13 ? Because that sounds absolutely awesome, but I can’t hear it anywhere in the actual OST. Please tell me its not just trailer sound design. I’ve wanted this soundtrack to be like this since I first saw this trailer when they initially released it.",5
"far from impressive
big fan of the books and story. The best parts of Dune 2 you can see in this trailer...many of the scenes are self indulging on good sound and screen effects - but each of the more passive scenes are just elongated unnecessarily (not that someboy would miss them in the storyline), as if Vilneuve had to fill 3 hours and his buget of 190Mio. wasnt enough.
The ""action"" you might expect after Dune1 and all the looong preparation in Dune 2 is more than sparse  and would have made this film to be watched a 2nd time... but yeahh ""professional"" critiques seem to love the great pictures but forget the pace, plot and action (even the books are offering more action!).
Pitty for the guranteed hype this film got, they could have done it so much better",5
"1:06 
""But wait, I hear they're Prissy, Bourgeois, and all that. 
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat? 
I don't think so, I'll see when i get there.
I hope they're prepared, for The Prince Of Bel-Air!""",5
" @maazahmed506  I will continue to disagree. I have watched the 1984 version of Dune dozens of times over the years and I am sure I will watch it at least a dozen more times in my lifetime. With this remake, once was more than enough. It was horrible, down to the lead character, a twinky looking, sounding, acting manchild that is supposed to come and liberate and lead the people of Arakis to create a new order and lead the known universe. It fell far short of convincing in every aspect of the film. All I can say is some of the visual effects were decent but given what is available these days even that could have been far better. I am just glad I got to screen it for free. I would have wanted my money back otherwise.",5
"I love the part where Scarface says ""say hello to my little friend"" and Dom says ""say hello to my family"" absolutely inspiring",5
Never seen this movie but I absolutely love this trailer,5
"One of the best films I’ve seen for a story of the jokers birth. This is a dark film and I just wish they would bring this world of Gotham out with Batman and Joker facing each other in a more dark DC telling of the comic books. They can’t let this one go,,,,WB,,,,have to fit this franchise in a separate world from other DC works,,got too. Would probably make more money too that way,,so hope they see sense. Great film for the beginning of it all in this Gotham world.",5
"Me :
The best movie of 2019.
One of the best psychological thriller.
And the best origin film of a remarkable character.

Meanwhile ; 
Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic : 🥴💩",5
"Just saw it in the cinema and man this is one of the best film series to come out in a long time. Absolutely blown away by the lore and action, some people find it long-winded and hard to keep up with but I was glued to the screen and captured by the plot the whole time. Dune is truly magnificent. I’m obsessed.",5
"Best film with few bummer here & there like
1) Nandi Astra potential not presented to the fullest, beside having 1000 Nandi power   struggling & not able to throw the truck down the hill in one move, it's looks like joke
2) in Deva Deva song grass & tree not getting burn
3) in last scene after complete attachment of Brahamastra, Ranbir's shirt burnt but not pant 😁, these are little mistake but not major
Apart from these Good points like
1) This is the top-notch graphics in Indian cinema till date
2) Big B is top reason to watch & Big B's last action is far better
3) Screenplay
4) Arijit Singh voice ❤️
   I hope in next installment, they come up with Bang by correcting these little bummers & make it available in 3D.
This gives boost to more makers to bring graphics in cinemas",5
You definitely should see this masterpiece in the cinema!,5
This is a beautiful piece on our history and culture. Our religion… I hope we see more new characters and hope the storyline is as beautiful as part 1,5
"I am pretty far behind on TV shows but this show is absolutely genius. One of my favorite comedies of the last 20 years, easily. Kudos to the Levys. If there's one single reason to watch this show, it's Daniel Levy as David Rose. Give this show a chance if you haven't yet... utterly brilliant.",5

"I finally watched Matrix 4 yesterday, and I find it a really good film. Even better than 2 and 3, but not as good as 1. So overall the second best Matrix film. However, I understand why so many people disliked it. It's because it was severely critical of sheeple and those mind slaves who followed the Covid 19 Plandemic measures, basically doing as they're told because the good old Guvment wanted the best for them.
Most people who took those vaccines see themselves criticized in this film, so of course they're gonna lash out against it.
This is a good and entertaining film, and is once again ahead of its time.
I'm pleasantly surprised!",5
"The best movie that i ever seen, speechless, i told to all my friends, you must watch this movie",5
"I adore Dune Part 2 so much. I've seen it twice already. What a fantastic movie, and hoping we get a Part 3!",5
honestly jared leto played a better joker,5
" @thomas316  It may just not be your type of humor. But I will say this: I watched 3-4 episodes. Didn't get it. A few weeks later everyone was raving about it, and I was like, I HAVE to be missing something, I'm going to give it another shot. It was a long time, maybe around the end of the second season before I found it funny..then later hilarious, and became obsessed. I think the writing got much better in the later seasons. I also think I had to get used to the pace of the show.",5
"I love the part when people thinks ""is this the final?"" and Toretto still says ""hold my next family movie"" and every episode is more awesome!",5
Best movie action comedy romance emotion all ❤,5

"One Year Old Now and it feels like yesterday
In the world of The Smile Game, there is a great force that rules over all: the force of the game itself. This force is made up of two opposing forces, love and hate, which exist in a delicate balance. Every player in the game is ruled by both love and hate, and their choices have the power to tip the balance in one direction or another.

At times, the force of love may be strong, leading players to choose actions that are kind, compassionate, and generous. Other times, the force of hate may be dominant, leading players to choose actions that are cruel, selfish, and hurtful. And sometimes, the balance may shift rapidly between the two, with players experiencing a whirlwind of emotions and choices.

But no matter which force is dominant at any given moment, it is important to remember that both love and hate are part of the same force that rules over the game. And just as players are ruled by both love and hate, so too is the game itself.

As players make their choices and interact with one another, they are influencing the balance of love and hate in the game. They may choose actions that increase the force of love, spreading kindness and compassion throughout the game world. Or they may choose actions that increase the force of hate, spreading darkness and despair.

Ultimately, the power to influence the balance of love and hate in the game lies in the hands of the players. Their choices have the power to shape the world around them, determining whether the force of love or hate will reign supreme. And it is up to each player to decide how they will use their power, and whether they will contribute to the forces of love or hate in the game.",5

Loved this movie very interesting plot. Left the theater satisfied 👏🏿,5
"This movie is an expierence and a freaking masterpiece (and way better than the trailer indicates)! Ive already given up on blockbuster cinema since I hate everything that Disney and Marvel have produced in the last 10 years, but this movie is like a breath of fresh air. I gained hope again that big productions can also be good movies, something which I thought to be impossible in 2024. 
Blockbuster cinema is dead; long live blockbuster cinema!",5
"I rarely watch TV, but this is so well written and executed!! The characters are hilarious, especially Daniel Levy !! ❤️ It !",5

"I am currently crying so hard right now. This is seriously the most beautiful, well put together story ever. I can’t believe how magical it was 1:12. That part truly made me shed a tear. And especially at 6:34 that part was just so truly heart touching words can not describe the series of emotions I felt. I absolutely loved the climax it had insanely excellent detail. Oh and we can’t forget the conclusion. The conclusion was the greatest and saddest conclusion I have ever seen better than any of the books I have read. Thank you so much for creating this absolute masterpiece. This is essentially the most important masterpiece of film history. It is a tragedy that this, it can’t be called a film, but a transcendent emotional experience, will be inaccessible for most. It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious. It stays vibrant, fresh, and revolutionizes the art of storytelling and filmmaking while making a damn of statement on what it means to be human. Entertaining, gripping, and simply exhilarating. This might be the most impactful piece of art I’ve come across in my life, and I’m definitely coming back to it in the near future to study it more deeply. this is an absolute masterpiece , I was brought to tears listening to this and seeing the bacon go whirly swirly in a circle countless times. it absolutely moved my soul , and I don't think I can ever be the same. this bacon has changed my entire mental state , I am now at peace with who I am and what I will be doing later in my life. I have forgiven all my enemies and now I am a man of a pacifist life. I will move on , got to move on , as the song says. the bacon is so inspirational , it shares it vast wisdom with all of us , and we are all so lucky that it would bestow it's great words with us. we are all children on bacon. hail bacon. hail bacon. The spinning bacon, rotating in one direction with this music... This made me tear up. How could such a bacon do such a thing? I'm struck by awe by this masterpiece. Especially when the bacon spins, showing its lightly salt covered tan skin. I can hear the crunch just from here, and so as the beautiful sound of the bacon scraping the dark, smooth velvet floor.  The flavor, music and everything can be heard, tasted, seen and felt from a screen. You can really hear the breaths between the music artist, empathizing her love for this rotating bacon. Truly what I call modern art. This was the most legendary performance by any piece of bacon I have ever watched. The acting was top tier and very life changing. This is one of the greatest work from a piece of bacon I have ever seen especially on 57:42.I am currently crying so hard right now.

It beautifully encapsulates the human struggle to its basics; suffering, pleasure, faith, despair. The work put in to this is incredibly inspiring. The graphics, the animation, the music, so much thought was put into it. This has remined me that you can do anything you put your mind to. Not even mentioning the memories, this makes me feel like an infant again, just laying my eyes on this beautiful masterpiece gives me all the good feelings in life. I also understand what happiness is again from this. Not even to mention the most incredible part that is 2:10. Bacon spinning has changed my life for the better. It connects with the characters within the viewers, individuals suppressed within our own subconscious.

It really inspired me to become an outstanding young man. Thank you.",5
"Finally got around to seeing this(Walmart had the DVD for $7).  It was good but I think it could have been better with Hugo Weaving and Lawrence Fishburne reprising their original roles.  Maybe tweaking the storyline a little too.  I’m not too disappointed because Reloaded and Revolutions weren’t as good as the first movie.  Over time, I came to accept them as part of the broader storyline.",5
Keuna love 💕 your films keep sherin ❤ love Louise from Dublin in Ireland ❤,5
"Great trailer but I’m glad I didn’t watch it til after the movie. They tease too much in these trailers, even though I’ve read the books and know what happens it was rewarding going in not having seen any of these scenes prior.",5
"I rarely get impressed with movies anymore, but this one was really impressive. 
Enough action to make it interesting, and a ton of character development to get you attached to him, make you understand who he is and his role in Batmans childhood. 
Watch it!",5
" @west_coast_nanny  Same here! I watched the first two episodes and did not feel it. After a few months I came back to give it another try. It started growing on me only after the middle of Season 2. The S2 finale was nice (touched by Johnny's courage and kind gesture at the dinner) and got me continue to season 3. Then season 3 got so much better (when all the Roses have jobs or purposes in their lives) and the rest is history. Now when I am recommending this show to friends, I ask them to be patient and not to give it up till the end of Season 2. This show is a gem but needs the audience to polish it a bit with patience before seeing this jewelry shine.",5

"Such a beautiful great movie with so many talented actors. Everyone did a really good job. And the movie had gorgeous scenes too. Timothee and Zendaya did so incredibly well, everyone did. I love Florence Pugh so I wish she was in it more",5
Is there anybody who is watching this masterpiece in 2025? Can't believe that it came out 6 years ago... But nowadays it looks so exciting just like at the first time😱😍,5

"Best adapted screenplay and picture nomination, 6 technical Oscar wins and it was the worst movie you have ever seen? Yeah right. Stick to Marvel bub.",5
I watched this in the movie theater with my friends and then it was three hours long and the movie was a cliff hanger. But don't get me wrong it was an awesome movie.,5
"I watched this movie well done to those creating the fast X, disappointed with the song angel how Vinny played the beginning of it, even though there was another way playing that song, as for the star himself Jason M, fricken beautiful, but everyone was amazing and the enjoyment of laughter was heard in my lounge by many of my neighbors. I look forward to the next movie sooner rather than later. Thank u to all involved creating this movie.❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🤜🤛💌",5

"My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it""
First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said, ""Fresh"" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air""
I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie, ""Yo holmes, smell ya later""
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air",5
"To give an honest review, Dune Part 1 was wayyyy better then Part 2 in terms of story atleast. Other factors were actually really good but how the story was compiled was not as good as dune 1",5
Great movie for sure and it will get oscar nominations for best picture and music score I think,5
"Truly stunning. I had goosebumps watching it in cinema. 10/10 would be underestimation. It's more like 100/10. More movies like this WP please. And, please get us a 16/9 aspect ratio Blu-Ray version for all Dune movies for your fans. We were waiting for it for ages. 
I've never went to the cinema twice for a movie. Dune 2 was THE exception.",5
" @brian4019  The show is amazing, the trailer isn't great but I highly recommend giving the show a chance.",5
"I love the series but I swear to god sometimes I feel like I  just want to slap Alexis and Moira right across their annoying, entitled self righteous faces.",5
I love this movie so much :),5
"Sometimes i rewatch it, because it is so much better then the movie itself. It's like you can imagine the perfect movie conclusion of the saga yourself.",5
" @sorenweber3599  
Sorry the very late my reply ！ 
How is your conditions and country ？ 
In Japan ,

"Wow! I struggled with this movie if I'm honest. I watched it over 3 days. Spoilers.... It begins like any serial killer movie, with the perp ( or victim depending on your point of view) spiralling toward violence due to his past. Paranoia, schizophrenia and delusion. there are a few  clues that tell us this us part  of  the DC universe along the way. It is in the final reel that this comes alive. Everything up to now finally makes sense as we begin to recognise the psychopath that is the Joker. To say i was blown away was an understatement. Marvel have done nothing that rivals the final 20 minutes of intense drama this movie gives as its finale. Oh. We also meet Batman. Just not in the way you expect it. Wonderful, simply wonderful.",5

"Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it""
First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said, ""Fresh"" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air""
I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie, ""Yo holmes, smell ya later""
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air",5

"The movie is officially 1 year old!!!

I saw it with my sister and her bf at amc on Christmas Eve 
Slogged in a few places but it got more interesting after the first 30 min 
There's so much funny self-awareness 
Loved seeing Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss back in their respective roles plus they actually gave them personality this time 
Glad to see Jada-Pinkett Smith again and it's refreshing to see new faces like Yayah-Abdul Mateen II and Jonathan Groff as newer versions of Morpheus and Agent Smith 
Neil Patrick Harris' role was quite a surprise too and Priyanka Chopra’s 
The action and the visuals continue to impress as well as digging into the human consciousness of the Matrix itself 
Seeing if choice is real, destiny is inescapable, fear and despair are perhaps too similar, feelings are easier to control than facts, and whether having absolute certainty or control is better than not knowing for sure 
The movie definitely makes up for the disappointment a lot of fans and critics felt from Matrix: Revolutions",5
"Oh my goodness! Am I not believing that one of the most successful movie franchise is reaching the end of the road? In fairness, this final installment is all about family and intense car chasing. Well, I’m excited to watch the film! 🙂😊😀😁🙌👍👌👏🙏🤞🎥🎬🎞🎫🎭🌟🚗🚘🛣️🏁🤍🖤❤️",5

"The Funny Part is the Cast of the Movie Brahmastra...

Ranbir Kapoor : Please remember his famous dialogue when he was giving an interview for some filmy channel where he openly said "" I am a Beef guy, I can Eat Beef everyday... It's shown in movie Brahmastra he gets a Power...I mean the choosen one ..😂😂

Amitabh : Who's filmy name is Amitabh Bachchan and Real life name  Inqalab Srivastava...who is a number 1 Womansier and who never stands support of Hindus or any religious events...but will carry Quran on his Head and pay his respect...he a true example of Double Standard...has also spoiled the life of many actors and actresses.

Shahrukh Khan: The father of a Drug Peddlers and Grandson of a Traitor (Shahnawaz Khan) Shahnawaz Khan was in the army of Shri Subhash Chandra Bose ji and when he was send to investigate the death of Shri Subhash Chandra Bose ji, he did not even visit the site and closed the case ...

Funny facts: The above all do not at  all believe in Hinduism or respect Hinduism...And very Easily Fool the Hindu Public To Watch their Movies and also appreciate them...😢",5

Wow, that's amazing to me because I love Japan so much though I haven't been there, and to hear that such a song is spread further to other parts of the world is exciting. 🤗",5
"I just watched this movie for the first time tonight. The famous short clips are just a TATSE of a more epic drama presentation, with well-placed action and suspense, that kept you interested throughout. 

Heath Ledger’s Joker was insane gangster crazy. But Joaquin’s Joker is Black Mirror-meets-school-shooter-docudrama crazy. 👀. I honestly thought about apologizing to some people I did wrong back in the day…like “I I’m sorry bro. I didn’t mean it. 🥺🙏🏽” But then I thought, “What if they’re crazy now, like Auther,…and it doesn’t matter all now 😬🤔” 😂

But the build up to the climatic scenes and the VERY sharp and emotional turning points that made you look forward to more, all the while still digesting what you’d just experienced, was executed very well…

The deep divide between the relatable, sometimes extreme, contrasting characters illustrated the theme of the movie in a simple but highly effective way. And along with the fantastic cinematography, this was well-done and deserving of the awards it received.

This is not just a standard “comic book movie” copy…but yet, it is. 🧐",5
"I never care for Joaquin Phoenix  acting He was patethic in Gladiator. But in this movie Joker He is perfect, brilliant. Well done!! !",5
Best movie in the world I love this movie really good movie 🔥🔥🔥,5
" @zaihussain9069  I don't think that's a good idea. Disney's not the way to go anymore with original content, I'm pretty sure the company's gonna go bankrupt anyway at the rate its going unless they fire the current CEO, rejuvenate their primary creative team and call off production on any future remakes...none of which I see happening anytime soon. I think Cartoon Saloon, an Irish 2D company (you should look into their films if you haven't, Wolfwalkers is the latest and it's fantastic) would do a great job on a Japanese-themed film since their art style would compliment the mythology nicely.",5

"This is the the only movie worth remembering in 2022, kyoki we were laughing for days on how ridiculous it was. But! Ayan bhai, concept was great and we hope you take some queues for the sequel (agar paisa bacha to), specially dialogue writers dhang ke hire kar lena. Saara paisa VFX mein daalna zaroori nahi hai.",5

You should watch kathi and mersal coz after watching jawan i feel like I   rewatched them both in short time period. But of course the journey was nice. SRK did an awesome work❤🎉,5
"Something about the idea of this movie, portrayed in the trailer when it first aired, was not interesting in the least. However, I recently watched We Own The Night, and something about Joaquin Phoenix' approach to his craft (communicated by him and his cast mates) made me more intrigued. I'm drawn to the darker side of entertainment (movies, music, photography) and that's what kind of changed my mind.

I just finished watching Joker. I almost stopped it/quit watching, an hour in. I got done, and looked at the total time of the movie and thought - ""There's 2 hours I'll never get back."" 

Joaquin's performance was definitely noteworthy. I think I had hoped/expected something else. I kept waiting for something to ""happen"" but it never really did. Probably one of the ""slowest"" movies I've watched in quite a long time.

Visually, the movie was fantastic. The tones were on point for the time it was intended to have been shot in. Some of the locations, and how/when they were shot were amazing, like the stairs, or when he walks through the archway of his apartment, at night, through the rain. The close ups of his face in vehicles were incredible, especially when he's in the police car and the reflection of chaos is evident, but not in focus.

Maybe I'd have to watch it a couple more times to gain a better appreciation, but, man, that could be like watching paint dry.",5

Also, Over the moon was really amazing, I loved the message they build with Cheng'e's story.",5
What an amazing blockbuster film 🎥 🎞 🎉❤,5
"I was thinking the exact same thing 😂 But i'm unsure if I'd want them to make their own or do it based on the story of the Bamboo Princess (which was already animated in Japan by Ghibli). It's be cool to see in 3D though :3
Also, ""Ponyo"" was inspired by the Little Mermaid (not the Disney one and not for plot) so it's not too far fetched. Still, I'd like to see an American animation movie based on Bamboo Princess maybe.",5
"The most ambitious, hype, perfectly building story and characters crossovers in the history of cinema.",5
"I went to watch the movie without watching the trailer. Moreover, I am not a typical SRK fan! Seriously!!
But after finishing the whole movie, I should say that this is not simply a movie. Rather, it's a journey towards growth, renovation, motivation.... It's a journey of emotion, romance, comedy, goosebumps, and whatnot!
Worth it as the way SRK nailed it in his own style with remarkable double acting!
Hats off!!  👏👏🎉🎉",5
"Honestly, dune 1 is one of the worst movies i've seen (because of the slow storytelling, not the direction or production quality, that is beyond anything i've ever seen). And i am surprised by myself to say this, but i am actually gonna watch the sequel in hopes of it being better, because Denis villeneuve is actually a pretty good director. I have to go to the hospital now, i'll tell them to check me for being ""open minded""🤢🤧🤕",5

"So technically I agree with this statement but I don't at the same time. Disney makes it a love story it's always about the couple. However lately in some of the live action movies, they haven't been doing all love stories (which I very much appreciate.) So yes there needs to be a movie of a Japanese Princess, but not romanticized.",5

He treats women with uncommon respect. He makes every person he talks to feel important and special. He has an incredible mind and an insatiable sense of curiosity about humanity. He almost never talks about the extensive charity work he does. He is a devoted husband and a protective and loving father. His dry, witty sense of humor includes a lot of sarcasm and tongue-in-cheek self satire which is often misinterpreted as arrogance. At the same time though, he never does false modesty. He says that his success is a combination of hard work and luck and he credits the luck to his parents sitting in heaven with ALLAH and asking Him to make things go right for their son. He's one of the very few famous people who is actually a good role model for the rest of the world. 

If you want a proper introduction to SRK👑❤🔥you should watch the movies of his that are considered classics. DDLJ, KKHH, K3G, KAL HO NAA HO, DILSE, SWADES, DEVDAS, KABHI HAAN KABHI NAA, MY NAME IS KHAN, CHAK DE INDIA. DDLJ❤ & PATHAAN👑❤🔥 in particular is a significant piece of world cinema history for several reasons. DDLJ ran for 20 years in a theater in Mumbai, it opened the global market for Hindi cinema, and it permanently changed the blueprint for the Hindi romantic hero. It's also just a silly, sweet, very enjoyable rom-com. 

When SRK👑❤🔥 said, ""he's the last of the stars"" that's true !! the kind of euphoria and stardom he got, which is ""SHAHDOM"" now haha!! no one after him till now was able to achieve what he got!! that's the self-confidence and love he got. He's truly an inspiration.

Now, this is a story all about how 

Minha vida virou de cabeça para baixo 
My life got flipped-turned upside down 

E eu gostaria de tirar um minuto 
And I'd like to take a minute 

Apenas sente-se aí 
Just sit right there 

Vou te contar como me tornei o príncipe de uma cidade chamada Bel-Air
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
Nascido e criado no oeste da Filadélfia 
In West Philadelphia born and raised 

No parquinho foi onde passei a maior parte dos meus dias 
On the playground was where I spent most of my days

Relaxando, maximizando, relaxando, tudo bem 
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool 

E todos jogando basquete fora da escola 
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school 

Quando alguns caras que não estavam fazendo nada de bom 
When a couple of guys who were up to no good 

Comecei a criar problemas no meu bairro 
Started making trouble in my neighborhood 

Eu entrei em uma pequena briga e minha mãe ficou com medo 
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared 

Ela disse: ""Você está se mudando com sua tia e seu tio para Bel-Air""
She said, ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
Eu implorei e implorei a ela dia após dia 
I begged and pleaded with her day after day 

Mas ela arrumou minha mala e me mandou embora 
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way 

Ela me deu um beijo e depois me deu meu ingresso 
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket 

Coloquei meu Walkman e disse: ""É melhor chutá-lo""
I put my Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it""
Primeira classe, isso é ruim 
First class, yo this is bad 

Beber suco de laranja em uma taça de champanhe 
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass 

É assim que vive o povo de Bel-Air? 
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like? 

Hmm, isso pode estar bem
Hmm, this might be alright
Mas espere, ouvi dizer que eles são certinhos, burgueses, tudo isso 
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that 

É esse o tipo de lugar para onde eles mandam esse gato legal? 
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?

I don't think so 

vou ver quando chegar lá 
I'll see when I get there 

Espero que estejam preparados para o príncipe de Bel-Air
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
Bem, o avião pousou e quando eu saí 
Well, the plane landed and when I came out 

Tinha um cara que parecia um policial parado ali com meu nome 
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out 

Ainda não estou tentando ser preso, acabei de chegar
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here 

Eu saltei com a rapidez como um raio, desapareci
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
Assobiei para um táxi e quando ele se aproximou 
I whistled for a cab and when it came near 

A placa dizia ""Fresco"" e tinha dados no espelho 
The license plate said, ""Fresh"" and it had dice in the mirror 

Na verdade, eu poderia dizer que esse táxi era raro 
If anything I could say that this cab was rare 

Mas eu pensei: ""Não, esqueça, holmes para Bel Air""
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air""
Cheguei em casa por volta das sete ou oito 
I pulled up to the house about seven or eight 

E eu gritei para o taxista: ""Ei, Holmes, cheire você mais tarde"" 
And I yelled to the cabbie, ""Yo holmes, smell ya later"" 

Eu olhei para o meu reino 
I looked at my kingdom 

Eu finalmente estava lá 
I was finally there 

Para sentar no meu trono como o príncipe de Bel-Air
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air",5

"This movie was amazing!!!! One of the best I've seen in a long time! I watched both part 1 and now part 2 in 4DX. It was so immersive and fun! Like a roller-coaster simulation. Not a boring moment. I highly recommend it! 

My sister and I could not stop taking about it the moment we stepped out of the theater. I hope this movie gets the viewership it deserves.",5
"Past couple of years stink and mental health has never been worse. To anyone who sees this comment, I hope you know that there's still opportunities and wonderful experiences you're more than welcome to despite it all. People out there who give a care (Arthur here even had Gary as someone who cared about him). Keep strong, have faith, and don't back down alright?",5
"This show is funny when Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, and/or Chris Elliott are on screen.
Otherwise, it's as bland as plain oatmeal. Some of the older characters are funny as well, but the young characters have no clue how to be funny. I get the impression the young actors don't realize they're in a comedy show.",5
Enjoying It Was great to see you guys for a great idea for me to get a good feeling of the most recent photos you have an awesome day at work on this one and he can come to your house 🏠,5
He just need love and respect.,5
Refused to watch this because I knew I would be watching the movie and wanted to avoid spoilers. Watched the movie last night (opening night) and WOW WOW WOW!!! As someone who hasn't been to the cinema in ages... this movie reminded me why I love sci-fi and why I love the cinematic experience. Truly incredible!,5
I love the part of the comments where people say they love the part where .......happens,5
" @bjird7278  lmao I am a marvel fan.
This joker movie is still better",5
"Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it""
First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said, ""Fresh"" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air""
I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie, ""Yo holmes, smell ya later""
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air",5

"Arrested Development had a couple, like Bob Loblaw. He's a lawyer and his name pronounced is Blah Blah Blah. 

I haven't watched this yet but based on the comments, I'm guessing I'll love it if I loved Arrested Development. I recommend that to anyone and everyone. Great writing, always funny, laughed out loud a lot. Both are similar. Rich family lost it all.",5
"I feel like I'm in a dream, this is a great movie😮",5
Not really feeling this one. Some of scenes looks like reruns. I hope it’s good this Franchise been on a winning streak now for 9 years minus Toyo drift. Be thought perhaps this is their lead for another 9 years of great film.,5
this show is the 2nd best show I've watched on Netflix it's so funny,5
"I love this type of movie, really great ❤❤",5
"I hardly ever go to the cinema anymore because of the pandemic but I have no doubt about it whatsoever because I watched this movie last night on my TV and even that was just pure awesome. Hopefully, I get my own home cinema one day so I can watch it again on the big screen :)",5
"How was Heath Ledgers joker portrayed as a “sad character”? He was nothing but a villain, nobody pitied him. People love him because of how well he was played, you’re allowed to like villains. 
Meanwhile this movie shows how the joker was made, why he became the joker in the first place.",5
"Just came back from the Cinema, firstly I am glad I didn’t watch this trailer.

THE MOVIE IS EPIC!!! A true masterpiece. I am glued to what they do next in this series.",5
"Hey, India has some pretty badass mythology and culture to draw on, which you could definitely make some awesome movies rooted in. I hope it has good subtitling ^^",5
"This show is so entertaining, I love it.",5
"Yet he won the Oscar and the other acting rewards like heath but jack didn't, it seems like you have a very unpopular opinion about this movie and Joaquin acting.
Also if you think Joaquin doesn't fit the Joker that's really because of the director rather than the actor.
Joaquin is a fantastic joker and this and his other performance proves that.
And little action? LOL this is a character study of course there isn't going to be much action.",5
This show took me by surprise. Pretty good tv show.,5

"I stopped watching trailers before watching the film years ago. Always too many spoilers. I love when a studio is willing to do short teasers though. 

This one is a prime example of spoilers. The worm riding scene in the theater was truly magical. I damn near wanted to stand up and cheer when all the fremen cheered. Had I watched the trailer first it wouldve just taken that magical feeling away for me.",5
No one is gonna talk about how he just spin like ‘ HELICOPTER HELICOPTER’and he fastened it I’m sorry it’s just to funny I just got back from china cuss it was to funny it got me floating while laughing to china your to good at it!,5
"Don't know people are complaining about this movie but as massive fan of matrix I enjoyed the movie a lot watching it in cinema it was completely different of what I might have expected, but regardless I did like it a lot and would easily would give it 10/10 for me on personal level it gave me a closer with the trilogy, and the whole story about the connection or bond between two people I think was made really great. Some people will love this movie some people will hate it, it is what it is and lets leave it at that, as Jim Rohn would say.",5
 @caesaraugustus4563  The movies are great and the books are some of the greatest pieces of sci-fi ever written.,5
"FYI this is not rokudan no shirabe, but rather it is midare, as it was titled by the very person who put together the album this song was taken from. If you listen to either composition you’ll notice that they are quite different and easy to tell apart. 

In fact an easy way to tell this is not Rokudan no Shirabe is with the sequence of notes starting at 1:22 which are not at all present in any other renditions of Rokudan I’ve heard. 

But if you listen to other renditions of Midare like the one by Kimio Eto, you’ll notice this same sequence of notes appear. Why? Because this piece is Midare, not Rokudan no Shirabe.",5
"Visually and audibly, it was amazing but you can still tell how difficult it is to transition the story to film. Many scenes could’ve used more work by trimming shots in the first half of the film and lending more exposition to scenes we came to see in the last half. Especially Paul’s transition to the Lisan al Gaib, which I expected to be a lot more powerful. Timothy did a great job portraying his transformation but I was missing the visual piece to believe it. The first film was very good at adventurous story telling and world building as well as giving us Paul’s visions, which helped us see what he was experiencing. Paul drinking the holy water should’ve been a bit scarier, showing us the old memories to come inhabit his brain, possessing him. Also, why did he not use the Weirding Way? Especially against Feyd? Where were the Bene Gesserit abilities we came to see? Jessica felt more terrifying than Paul did.
The major battle scenes could’ve benefited from having a few more shots as they seemed too quick to pass. I wanted to rewind the film to see it once more. The final event felt a bit rushed. Overall, the film was great for a general audience but for hardcore fans, I feel the first film was balanced better in making you believe the world you were temporarily suspended in. The second film felt more like a military film, which is fine and makes sense but it needed more strange and more scary. We certainly got that from the Harkonnen. 
I think I’m okay with Alia not being born and the change made to Chani feeling betrayed by Paul. I don’t understand why Thufir was cut. I don’t understand why Mentats were all but missing from the film.",5

" @doctor.networks  I have to see it again for sure. I might do so this weekend. I definitely caught myself nitpicking at part 2 more than I did with part 1. I think part 2 has a bit of a pacing issue compared to part 1, which feels more balanced. I didn’t dislike it and I’m happy the story exists in a style on film I wholeheartedly appreciate. I just feel it could’ve been even better.",5
"Oooh... Is that so?

So you're offended over the obvious play on the S-word, which is ironically way more frowned-upon than the B-word across so called ""First World""? (Contrary to places such as South Asia where the S-word is just an obvious ❗ whereas B-word is very frowned-upon — at least legally, if not socially!) As in, the very same S-word which is deemed as scatological or digestive-thingy way more than a simple exclamation, amIright? (Huh... Which reminds me that just as the wonderful act called ""blasphemy"", there's no parental-guiding marker for scatology (comedy or not) as of yet.)


P.S. Your pop-culture ref due to your discomfort over the genius of a white old man by bringing-up an already-familiar flick compels me to make a slightly off-topic remark: Huh... Even though the half of the title of that movie i.e. ‘idiot’ is itself a harsh-word but whatever, whatever.. I really do think it's a pretty clever title! I meant, of course: Democracy is the best-possible idiocy in ruling-system — after all! 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾",5

"@southerncritic9090  yeah... first is alright. Not bad. But don't miss out on the experience.

"Like so many others, I'm a huge movie fan; and even, perhaps, a somewhat - on small level - movie buff. That being said, there's many film trailers in & of themselves I would regard as, classic; and though, I have not yet seen 'this' film, it's trailer I think is one of the best I've seen in the most 'recent' times. 
Yes, like a dork, I've watched & listened to it over & over again (quite 😉)a few times. 
Good times... 😁✌️",5

Thank you Mr Villeneuve rise and shine",5

I love the part where I was too busy laughing at the comments instead of watching the trailer,5
This film made me remember what it feels like to watch a truly great movie,5
Love the Action between SRK and John. IT was freaking AWESOME!!!! JOHN ABRAHAM was the BEST Villain. Awesome acting by both SRK AND JOHN. Thats the only thing i enjoyed in this film. NO chemistry between SRK and Deepika. So far they did 4 movies together and no chemistry between them. SRK and Kajol is the best jodi for sure but Katrina and Aushka have more chemistry with SRK than Deepika.  I dont know why they keep putting Deepika in all SRK film.,5
Love Catherine O'Hara - so happy to see her.,5
I hope the CG FX are better than part one. Some sequences in the old Lynch version looked better. I guess the lion's share of the budget went on the all-star cast.,5

" @trevorsutton8427  I agree. Box office sales don't mean much. Although Bladerunner 2049 was a box office failure unlike Dune, I and many others greatly enjoyed it and revere it. 

I don't know anyone who's seen close to 25k movies and shows.. perhaps my father must've seen movies and shows close to that number as he's avidly watched movies since he was in his 20s as he owned some kind of home video rental store for a while which sparked his interest in media. He's almost 60 now and he still watches stuff on Netflix and such. 

You should consider posting some videos up on your channel, perhaps you can recommend some lesser known hidden gems that you've come across and share your thoughts on the works that've stood out for you.",5

The picture isn't bad either, and goes pretty well with the music. I have to admit, I clicked for the painting alone - and I was not disappointed!

This is the best movie of Joker yet nothing else and nobody could imitate Phoenix he's the best God blessing God bless you to finish we don't need no second Parts cuz this did it second part won't spoil it glad to ending 2 years and I keep looking at it everyday everyday once I get home here I go in and never get tired of it because I'm speechless for work I'm proud of you finished volume movies and this is the best one yet how do you put all your movies over and over and over by the way God bless you and your wife I'm so glad for you congratulations you found love and she's so beautiful inside and out I think I seen her with a baby thank you ask if you had a baby already I seen how it would have Babies R Us congratulations I love you,5

Some movies you can watch countless times and enjoy like interstellar then there are movies everyone says are awesome like avatar 2 and yet I don't ever wanna watch it ever again. I don't care when a movie or show is made as long as it's good    black sails was a great TV show and yet noone mentions it.

New King James Version
3 For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but according to their own desires, because they have itching ears, they will heap up for themselves teachers; 4 and they will turn their ears away from the truth, and be turned aside to fables. 5 But you be watchful in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.

Revelation 18:20-24
New King James Version
20 “Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!”

Finality of Babylon’s Fall
21 Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, “Thus with violence the great city Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall not be found anymore. 22 The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters shall not be heard in you anymore. No craftsman of any craft shall be found in you anymore, and the sound of a millstone shall not be heard in you anymore. 23 The light of a lamp shall not shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not be heard in you anymore. For your merchants were the great men of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived. 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who were slain on the earth.”",5
" Elementary Watson  I know what the 4th wall is. ""Breaking the 4th wall"" means that a character is directly referring to the fact that they are in a show/book/whatever. This can be done by a character speaking directly to the viewer/reader, referring to the play they are into, to the audience, the fact that they are characters, or anything along these lines. More generally, it could be any direct influence of the fact that the story is a story into the story itself. For instance: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7d/Little_Nemo_1907-12-01_panels_3_and_4.jpg

A meta-reference, on the other hand, is merely a reference of the fictionality of the work into the work itself, but such that on a literal level, it is not the case. An example would be a book character says ""we are not in a book"" or if I said ""we are not in a youtube comment section"".

Are you now convinced that I know what ""breaking the 4th wall"" means?

So the question is: does George understand that he is in a sitcom, and would he have said such things if they were not in a sitcom? My point is that yes, George understands that he is in a sitcom and tries to make Seinfeld realize that too. But George needs to be subtle, he cannot just tell Seinfeld ""hey we are in a sitcom, relax!"", for this would completely break Seinfeld's mind. We see here that the fact that this takes place in a sitcom has a direct influence on the course of the show. George would have never referred to a sitcom where they are the characters if they were not truly in a sitcom. For this to be a meta-reference and not a breaking of the 4th wall, George would need to not realize that what he says is true, which is obviously the case.

PS: I do not fuck my teachers so you cannot be my fucking teacher.",5
"Agreed. It's not perfect in many ways, but after ""Revolution"" and what happened to nearly all the characters, it's nice to see them again, and be given another shot at a game that was initially rigged from the start.

There was a dude looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't tryin' to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness, like lightning: disappeared.

I whistled...

"***** yes, this clip sucks. the cleverness and range of the show as a whole is remarkable though. larry david is a comedy genius, and jason alexander, julia louis-dreyfus, and michael richards nailed it.",5
"I thought the movie was alright, nowhere near the iconic nature of the originals (especially the first one), but ok in its own right. The trailer is honestly so good I'm not sure the movie could have lived up to it. Whoever chose the background music never got a choice more right than that.",5
best show after friends,5
"I get what the movie was going for, but didn't love it. Still, this trailer was perfect and had the best use of White Rabbit since Red Faction 2.",5
Yummy member the metrics only one story read amazing show time like you you’re good brother coming spider Street help me come,5
"No, the actual movie didn't live up to the trailer but I thought it was still a fun movie to watch, just the fact we got another Matrix movie was exciting enough.  I'm not sure how it could've rivaled the original, so cutting edge back in 99.  I still think it would have done good enough $ to warrant a sequel had it not been released when it was- WB should've held it longer, released it after Top Gun.",5

"Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it""
First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright
But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said, ""Fresh"" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air""
I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie, ""Yo holmes, smell ya later""
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air",5
"I really enjoyed the movie but I really think someone else needs to make the matrix sequels someone LessTransgender who respects the franchise 


But look at what happened with Disney

One of the points of the film is Andy had to make the film without his brother whether he liked it or not 

The whole gnostic element of the originals I don’t know what this movie is in terms of spiritual metaphors 


We must accept that transgendersareCrazy

And spectrums are binary
And life is binary",5
+YarrBr0 Nos valen verga esos chistes is spanish for We don't give a shit about that jokes. Just laugh dude.,5
I love too Will Smith he makes me laugh too much😂😂😂😂😂,5
"Will starts off begging not to go to his aunt and uncle's house in Bel-Air but as soon as his mother sends him out the door, he's immediately happy and excited about going?",5
"0:11 1:54 Star Wars: Love the part when the old woman wishing Dom like ""May the rides be with you"" like Star Wars ""May the force be with you.""

3:28 Jurassic Park/World: Imagine if Letty is like ""You, why does it always have to be you?"" Like reference from Jurassic World ""Bigger, why does it always have to go bigger?""",5
LMAO at those who can't keep their mouth shut and just let people enjoy things when it's not hurting them for others to love what they love.,5
"That was ALSO a reference to classic tv-shows, where the ""hero"" often used to look at the camera and smile, wink etc. And Jerry was basically Superman in this episode: he had a girlfriend called Lois, he was facing off against a former rival Duncan Meyer, and the episode ended with him winning the race and getting the girl. Perfect setup for one of those moments!",5
"I know nothing about The Matrix. I haven’t seen any of the movies. I heard mixed things about this one in particular. But man, this trailer is beautifully put together and I’ll watch it on occasion because of how perfect it is.",5
"look up Kensington ave it probably wasn't as bad in the  early 90s(,or so I've  heard)but whoa! don't do drugs etc. I knew philly was a rough city but 😳 and yeah Detroit has gangs but... public intoxication I don't ever want to find myself in their shoes I pray that I never do! (scary thoughts!! ) and yes I know former drug addicts been recovered for decades (Thank you Jesus! ) even parents but we're in mid ohio and we have had the helicopter do sting operations to bust drug dealers but they are concealed not so much in philly! especially a certain area....",5
I honestly loved the part when Nosferatu said “……” and dominic torretto replied with “family.” Truly one of the scenes of all time.,5
Ok don’t yell at me but these movies lost it’s touch-for me-when Paul Walker died. Something about it just seemed too inappropriate to watch…idk but THIS looks AMAZING!!! I’ve seen this trailer a few times now and every single time I get goosebumps and wish I was that BA to be in a movie like this!! My dream has always been to be in action movies and im the baddest chick lol and my other dream is to be in horror movies. But man!!!! This looks amazing!!,5
Oh I am very happy that you call Akshay Kumar big star More then Shahrukh Imagine Watching Jawaan In Theatres It Would Not Put me in Hospital Amazing movie Jawan,5
Haha whats all with I love the part comments😂😂,5
"LOL. I see after I posted my comment about The Race episode that many others had done the same. I forgot who I was dealing with here.
A personal note: A few years ago I was sitting next to a man with a beard at a restaurant at Farmers Market in L.A. He was on a Kindle. I asked what he was reading. He said it was an obscure book that I never heard of. Quicksilver by Neal Stephenson. I impressed him by telling him I'd read the entire trilogy and rattled off the names of the other 2.
As we spoke, I told him he looked familiar.  He said he was an actor and had appeared in a number of things. I looked hard at him through the beard and got it. ""Does your name start with a....Duncan Meyer"" I said. I received a chuckle from Don McManus for that.",5
"Veto Bandito I think that's a completely asinine statement since How I met your mother was a much more formulaic show where as Seinfeld in comparison was groundbreaking for its genre. The reason that Seinfeld is still so popular  today is because it did something totally unorthodox for Sitcoms of its day (and some would argue is still revolutionary compared to most modern sitcoms) I think the fact that people still go back to it to this day boils down to it being a really damn good show, more than people looking at It through rose colored glasses. 

Seinfeld is a show that's been able to gain popularity with people of various generations, including some younger ones over the course of decades. Where as at this point, its not known if How I Met Your Mother will endure past this generation.",5
"I think its more and more clear that Matrix was a product of its TIME same as movies like Alien / Predator/ Commando /Star Trek etc. And people living in present time just can't make it right. Even if people who were present or were actually making the movies cant make it same way impactfull as it was back then.. As a 90s kid I was looking forward to have awesome CGI animations instead of crappy animations. Big hope for me were series like ST TNG or Voyager, StarGate or movies like Jurassic Park and The Thing.. but now its mostly a general fail.. 
Sorry, brothers or sisters or whatever, but this feels already terribly same as the attempt before.. 
Its the similar thing when you love some song  which is well known but the artist couldn't repeat it.. 
The Matrix 4, is when you realize that the Wachowski sisters have a lot to learn from their brothers.",5
"oh man, that means youve never seen arrested development. oh god, i wish i were you. i would love to have my memories of seasons 1-3 whipped from my memory so i can rewatch it fresh",5
Wow SRK wow this is the greatest film ever I have seen in my life ❤,5
"Dad what where the 90s like ? 
Watch ""The fresh Prince of Bel air"" and you get a pretty good picture... oh and listrn to Eurodance",5
It’s amazing how I haven’t heard that for years and years and years and yet didn’t forget a single word lol once you know it you know it lol 😂,5
"U.S. mainstream sitcoms: first there was The Phil Silvers Show, then Seinfeld, The Larry Sanders Show, and lastly Curb Your Enthusiasm. Seinfeld was very ground-breaking  but it does have a precedent. I would love to know if Jerry and Larry were aware of Tony Hancock and the classic Ray Galton and Alan Simpson scripted radio shows from the 1950s. A very similar premise.",5
Malcolm in the Middle is pretty great though.,5
The absolute best trailer of all time. If the movie was half this good it would have been amazing!,5
I'm watching that movie right now sending this to my friend to get him hip to watch the movie. I was so very happy for a new chapter,5
Special effects were SO MUCH better back in the original matrix...,5
"I still watch this trailer regularly. Love the use of ""White Rabbit"" and the imagery promises something way better than what the movie ended up being. More Matrix is never a bad thing tho.",5
"​​ @soumenmaji673  mujhe aata hain English thik hain. Aur tere jaise hi bohut saare burbakk ko roj sikhata hoon .

 @Sbastjan did you know that your statement isn’t true at all.  Fun fact. Enjoy. 👍,5
"Honestly, better than the last two and still fun as always. It was fun like always but wasn’t too over the top and the villain was very entertaining. Solid 8/10 for me.",5
PLEASE let this get Oscar Nominations in ALL CATEGORIES for tomorrow's announcement!!!!!!!!! Seeing Dune: Part Two in IMAX was the GREATEST MOVIE EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!!!!!,5
"I used to cringe at people who were like ""I don't like it, therefore it's not canon"" but now that I had the misfortune of seeing that utter dogshit of a movie, I understand them completely. Almost certainly the last movie in the Matrix universe in my lifetime, and it's this? Sweet mother of Jesus",5
The show is super great you should watch it,5
"Bad.. Very bad movie.  Only because people love Reeves they praise it. But really it was garbage. 
Reeves needs better story and solid action in his movies to be hit. Regarding pure acting, sorry he is way behind. 
He is good person and thats why we all love to see him anyway",5
"I love the part when Gandalf says ""You shall not pass"" but Dom says ""My family will pass"". Truly an inspiring moment",5
It was perfectly edited with this perfect music.,5
"Just finished watching the last episode and special of this wholesome decent beautiful series 🤩 the best show I have watched in years much love to producers Dan and Eugene Levy, Catherine O’Hara and all the crew absolutely brilliant!! A timeless classic comedy ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤",5
"This movie is utterly brilliant. A gift. The most human blockbuster of the decade so far, one that demonstrates its director/writer's evolution of perspective after so many years (in aesthetics, philosophy, values), and offers up a fresh (and at the same time completely faithful) understanding of an old mythos. It's a healing experience for someone whose heart was broken by Revolutions back in the day. 

My adolescence was defined by the Matrix trilogy—as in, I haunted message boards on the daily to discuss theories and philosophize with folks during the release of the sequels. I still can't believe Resurrections exists. Feels like Lana made it just for me. The kids who whine about it are just that ... kids. (Not just talking about age, mind you—talking about mentality, maturity, one's level of media literacy ... dear God, media literacy today is so under-taught, it's painful.) Maybe one day, they'll come back to it with new eyes. After all, it took over a decade for folks to start appreciating Reloaded and Revolutions...

Not holding my breath, though. Glad Lana didn't make it for them.",5
"This movie was fine at best, but the editor of these two trailers needs some award. Made the film look twelve times better than it was",5
"Just watched the movie, it was so good!!! highly recommend",5

 @Rando_Commando  bro just don’t watch it if you love the originals. Just trust me bro.,5
"One of the best tv shows to ever exist trust me this trailer doesn’t capture the show, ITS SO GOOD",5
"Superb BlockBuster Movie🔥
Everyone watch this movie please Guys This Is superb duper blockbuster movie",5
"Finally watched Dune part 2. Phenomenal cinematography and music, but how on Arrakis could they get Chani and Paul's relationship SO WRONG??!!! And without the payoff at the end of the book, when Jessica compares Chani to herself.
'Do you know so little of my son?' Jessica whispered. 'See that princess standing there, so haughty and confident. They say she has pretensions of literary nature. Let us hope she finds solace in such things; she'll have little else.' A bitter laugh escaped Jessica. 'Think on it, Chani: that princess will have the name, yet she'll live as less than a concubine - never to know a moment of tenderness from the man to whom she's bound. While we, Chani, we who carry the name of concubine - history will call us wives.'",5
"I'm going to get a lot of hate for this comment but tbvh where have our standards gone? This movie makes zero sense. From Deepika Padukone having a whole ass baby shower in a central jail, convicts being handed their own guns in the name of women empowerment, to Sanjay dutt's abrupt entry and poorly written role, that added no value to the actual script, are just some of the examples that show that this movie has no logical basis. The only reasons why this movie earned so well was because of:

1. The inability of die hard srk fans to use their own discretion and blindly consume anything that stars their favourite hero

2. The action sequences- although well shot, most of them just came out of nowhere and simply made no sense

3. The emotional undertones- ""look at srk fighting for the rights of our farmers 🥹"" 

4. Die hard Deepika Padukone fans

I am not an srk hater, nor am I trying to sound woke with this comment..I love Bollywood, but this was just a massive cash grab..audience, please, i think it's high time we're more selective about our movie choices..anything that includes a few good songs and some action scenes is defined as a blockbuster.. where's the storyline? Why are people like srk and Salman Khan, who are in their 50s and 60s, romancing women half their age? 

Movies like Rocky and Rani ki Prem kahani, that are entertaining, have important social messages, and most importantly, have storylines that FOLLOW A LOGICAL SEQUENCE are not given enough credit!

I know this will offend a lot of people but this movie is a classic example of emotional manipulation..it is poorly written storyline revolving around the plight of farmers (not saying that the issue isn't important, it absolutely 100% is, but it could've been shown in a much, muchh better way)..the filmmakers knew that this is a touchy topic for most Indians..bas, fir kya tha..2 acche stars le liye, 10-12 bhayankar action scenes, Arijit ke cute cute gaane, aur sabki pav bhaaji bana ke de di audience ko..aur audience khush! :)",5
"Why I think this woman and her circles din kno wtf they were doing,or didn't take situations seriously.
Even if you're being delivered from a serious spirit, possible possession,yoooo, you watch the person, take em to church, and talk about it, follow up, even if it's for some fkn months, maybe why this bringing me to the actual nightmare, where God gave from spiritual to physical signs!
Because I know I still on earth, and connected probably, to the spirit world here.

Maybe Jesus going to destroy this, two way picture, God knows yooo I saying prayers,' as I walk through the valley of the shadows of death, maybe I in between worlds?

Maybe Jesus gotta unblock the blockage? Then download me, the right matrix and my strong medicine is strong softness, gentleness, tenderness, love.",5
The code was designed and created for a specific purpose - to trigger an emotional response. Compassion and empathy for this rainbow coloured planet we call home and to save humanity from itself.,5
"I rarely get hooked on shows, but this show was an exception. The characters, plots, storylines, were well thought through and consistently enjoyable throughout all seasons. The humor was unmatched, the storylines exciting, and the characters genuinely likeable. I looked forward to coming back to more episodes and it gave me true joy to watch them. I do hope that the creators will consider a reboot - it would be a waste not to do so. I believe in you, you can do it, if you continue doing what you have been doing, it will be a success!",5
"This is one of the best shows I have ever seen. I binged through all six seasons in 2020 (during covid lockdown) and now I've just rebinged through all of them in 2024. So many belly laughs and laugh out loud moments strewn across all six seasons, but also so much kindness, tenderness and heart. I love every single character in this show but Moira and Alexis literally steal my heart.",5
"I saw it twice in the cinema. Yesterday and today. 😂
AMAZING MOVIE! LOVED IT",5
I couldnt watch it. I refuse to further tarnish memories of one of the greatest movies ever. For the love of god stop.,5
"I just watched it on Netflix and I honestly don't understand all the hate, it's far from perfect but I still thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Love to see more Matrix even if it doesn't really make any sense (did it ever though? Lol)",5
"You can’t play it safe when you write the storyline of a science fiction like the Matrix series. 
The writer was trying to appeal to the newcomer by recalling fragments from the past episodes. 
and also following a familiar and established plot line. 
This made the movie bland. 
The movie lacked the innovative and imaginative elements of the first three Matrix movies. 
Gone are the days of the enthusiastic and daring science fiction productions. 
It’s all about the bottom line now.",5
LOL this can't be the actual trailer. It basically recaps the first episode XD,5
Will  Smith's second greatest hit :),5
I love part where Mister Rogers says “It’s a beautiful day in the neighborhood” and dom says it’s a beautiful day to be a family. Man…,5
​@neech1311 Lol that was great dialogue in that scene neo couldn't believe it was smith great stuff👍,5
I have autism. And I love this show. I used to watch it as a child. I now watch it 20 years pn as an adult. I have the boxset. I laugh continually at it. Xx,5
He's so great but man have some dignity for God Sake just get away from your toxic wife who uses you and humilliates you come on you deserve better,5
everyone is talking about how the trailer is good? what about the actual movie? was it good? i mean How could they ruin the Matrix one of the greatest movies of all time? How dare you Warner Bros for making a garbage movie and click bait users by another legendary movie's name? this is a robbery and whoever made this trash should be shut down from work completely ! Just like Marvel's movies... going down ! you'll get NO STAR !!!,5
SPOILER ALERT!  Anya Taylor Joy has A surprise cameo in this film.,5
"A film so ponderous and in love with itself and characters so tedious, while at the same time resembling a National Geographic shoot of a future world, it's the most pointless masterpiece I've ever sat through",5
"I for one loved this movie. 
1. They get to throw shade at WB for making them do this is a very clever way
2. The recasts are symbolic to the story
3. Neo and Trinity get a happy ending.",5
lol yeah i love how the cop just wags his baton at him,5

I pulled up to a house about seven or eight And I yelled to the cabbie: Yo home, smell ya later Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air",5
Awesome awesome movie,5
"Just finished the movie in netflix, Loved it, I can understand why people might not like it, Seriousness was toned down, but the comedy moments was funny and the script dialogue's breaking the 4th wall to the audience and sending a message, there could be another sequal maybe another actor or another location for the matrix, if not, then we could go with Catflix lol.",5
"One thing that totally doesn’t disappoint me was the hand to hand combats in this movie, 
literally uplifting the standards of Indian hand to hand combats!!
Peace ✌🏼",5
"Definitely. If u find at least one episode humorous, then you'll enjoy it",5
"Now, this is a story all about how
My life got flipped-turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air

In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin', all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it""

First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright

But wait, I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that
Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?
I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

"Why 2013. Why didnt I find this show earlier when it first debuted?? 😭 I just wished I could have watched this 5 years ago because I was so much happier and more free as a late adolescent than an adult. Oh my god. I still love this show, I just wished I didn't have  to watch and also aware of the all underlying allegories to contemporary issues in society and in an adult's life (co-worker  relations, r/s - plantonic and romantic, professional, learning to deal and accept with reality e.g. Jake coming to terms with his father's apathy after denying this for his whole life), that I watch this and I identify so much with this show, that I draw parallels of what I watch with my life. It appeared initially when I first knew about this show on tumblr from gifs that it's mockumentary-esque sitcom, similar to The Office or Park & Rec. I started watching officially only last year and my initial take after 5 eps was that it was mildly humourous and light-hearted (without being over the top or in your face). I have since finished S2 and a few eps from S3 and I could see how the show have pivoted especially between s2 and s3. I  know I lament the timings I discovered the show, but I still love it. I don't have the disposition to sit through a drama or a book (works of fiction) because r/s generally tire me. But when I watch b99, I feel happy. It demonstrates that r/s between adults can be healthy and good when you are with good people. And this means a lot to me.",5
Great trailer you can just watch away from the movie however the movie was so great and give a  new idea for the new plans for the matrix to keep control and the idea to set teranity free and how deep matrix can play with our minds.,5
Literally jawan is the best thriller-action movie words cannot describe this movie I remember that time when Deepika and the kid was talking with each other at the last time make me cry the storyline is so amazing and beautiful and those 6 girls Play a very amazing role in the movie it's a amazing movie❤,5

Okay these are my hopes for I know fast 10 is going to make a lot of money. People are going to definitely want to see this fast cars shooting hot women. Tons of things like that are going to sell but this is what I'm hoping for for the parents this week this Friday when this movie goes. Please everybody don't just drag your kids to see this movie fast has to make plenty of money without that help I'm hoping. Really hoping that super Mario Brothers movie by the way made by universal same as the fast films. Like what you're saying. I want to see parents drop their kids off to see super Mario Bros. It makes that globally bigger for families and children of all ages simultaneously while people go see fast 10 because that is a great way to separate the two and that way your kids can enjoy what they wish and you can help make this movie is for adults as you know you want to. But I really want to see universals super Mario Brothers movie. Do you even better before the next two weeks before they leave? So please please people take your kids and let them see you supermarket brother as well. You see fast hand and repeating myself because Superman brothers the movie needs to make much much more money. Show Hollywood how it's done and get them off their high horse of the wokeness that's not impressing anybody. Nobody wants to hear rich people tell them about their lives while they sit in their ass is doing nothing. What privileged women like you know. Brie Larson who need to get over the missile is so please again I hear my plead super Mario Brothers movie needs to do even better. It's made 1.2 million so far and i am a fan that wants to see it making much more. I played the game games as a kid and I want I want to see a sequel happen for this Charlie Day plays who ouija and that was so awesome for me to get to see as a fan. I am a huge fan and I want to see more happen there. I am not trying to disrespect fast and furious fans. I'm going to be honest. I was a fan of the series but then Paul Walker's passing just kind of left me on your trusted as it went on. So I don't know if anyone's going to be reading this a half as long as I'm writing. But my point comes down to just forget about the breed Larson world and let's help make kids happy again with the world of super Mario Brothers and sequels like donkey Kong and God knows what else we could have if we help make those movies just as big as the fast films. So please please people consider dropping your kids off does he super Mario Brothers movie a few more times before it's too late? It's going to be coming on Blu-ray and digital copies and stuff. But let's make this movie. Make more money while we can and show Hollywood how this is done. I know it was going to be reading this that long but Hollywood needs to learn you hear me Hollywood you're done Hollywood😂😂😂😂,5
Huge respect for NAYANTHARA. What a screen presence. Truly a LADYSUPERSTAR,5
"I've just seen it. I thought it was FANTASTIC. Much like the last episode of GOT, everyone expected one thing, and thought they didn't get it. Guess what Guys, we got it and IT WAS FABULOUS. Thank you to the Matrix Crew. I loved it. Just making an Irish cuppa to go watch it again.",5

Lol same thoughts i discovered B99 because of the I WANT IT THAT WAY clip i saw on yutube once ........ thats when i knew i would love the show😂😂😂😂👌,5
"@mattdayman9632: 
Ditto That 👍
 I am now 75 years young and I loved the Matrix snd all the Matrix movies.
When I took my niece to the theater to see the first one, she walked out! I asked why she left, and she replied, ""It's nonsense,!""...  I replied, ""It is just a movie 🎥!""

I was also disappointed with this last one, whoever when she caught him at the End, I understood the setup of the director, and Why Trinity had to play that part! Trinity represents the concept of the Yin and Yang ☯️ of the Tao. Two polar opposites with different strengths and power. Yin is Woman and Trinity represents the Power of Women.

​ @d3fct  That's terrific!   Such a lovely TMNT cartoon!   And in one wedding episode of Fresh Prince of Bel Air they made a Ninja Turtles reference due to James Avery being affiliated with both shows.,5
"For a matrix fan, this movie tied everything together and some more. I really liked how they mixed old parts into the new matrix. Agent smith and the Analyst were great additions. Very witty.  “The Analyst: The sheeple aren't going anywhere. They like my world. They don't want this sentimentality. They don't want freedom or empowerment. They want to be controlled. They crave the comfort of certainty.”",5

"i was so excited for this movie. it would have been the first matrix film i would see in the theatres, and then i went to watch it and...

you know, i actually enjoyed the movie for what it was. 
i expected something more important, and was disappointed in that regard, but i love this movie to bits for doing its own thing, especially after revolutions already ended the great epic story of the fight against the machines. still, i was dissapointed after 1-3 borrowed so much from our larger culture but ressurections seemed to only borrow from the matrix's ideas...

this movie has its flaws, it could have been better in its own space, maybe its bad, but i still find that there was love behind it, and, in the end, i still love it.",5

Rohan Jolly dude i was in this same situation.. started brooklyn nine-nine and fell in love with it. now that i’ve finished season 5 i can honestly say it’s almost better than friends. and i LOVEE friends so much! take it from me: watch it,5
LOL typical Bollywood crap. One larger than life hero that is an A lister that never ages and has an unrealistically larger than life lead in a movie. Typical feel good story about one man fighting am army and yes dance numbers along the way with a romantic interest. Ofcourse and the Indian public will love it. Can Bollywood every do a good sci-fi movie or action movie that is on par with Hollywood or just a true story with no songs ? nope. The audience never change therefore the movies don't change.,5
"Everyones making these terrible ""I loved when he said..."" jokes in the comments, proving that they're bot true fans. 22 years we've been on this road, whether it's a quarter mile away or half way around the world. We've gained family and lost family throughout this franchise and people feel like it's just died off. But no. It's grown, grown from a small group of friends who loved cars, to a unstoppable family who will always protect the world from the worst. Yeah, I don't care whats crazy or dramatic or unrealistic about thus franchise. Because thats always what this world has been based on: fun unreasonable enteertainment. And this franchise? I don't even need to say what it's based on. And for those who want to blast me in the comments after reading this: ""I said forget about cuh.""",5

"Say what you want about the movie, but this trailer is so well done.

I'm one of the few who actually enjoyed the movie tho 😅 Maybe it was because I was a little high but I liked how overtly self-referential it was to the legacy of The Matrix as a franchise in an age of sequels and reboots. 

Plus,  Neo and Trinity got their happy ending and that makes me happy 🤷🏽‍♂",5

"The movie's biggest sin was that it wasn't anywhere near as transcendental, mind-bending or epic in scope as the trailer promised. It was actually a surprisingly small-scale story given the massive stakes of the original trilogy. And the absence of Lilly and the original choreographers was felt - it lacked the spirituality in narrative and the strength of the fight scenes of the original trilogy. Even so, as a satire of modern Hollywood and corporatism, it was a solid movie, despite its tangible faults.",5
Now this trailer is awesome and epic i wish the movie was better,5
I think this movie did not work because they were not able to set the expectations right. Fans were still in that old world of Matrix. I loved the movie. It was a big relief from the superhero and same storyline sci-fi movies fatigue. It was indeed a beautiful love story in the world of Matrix.,5
Amazing! Fantastic!,5
"I'm not looking to speak for other people, but I'm quite positive about the fact that nobody cares about memes here",5
" @CyberStriker  It's not garbage, but it needs a lot of polishing, and a rework about how it was presented, I think. It was too intellectual, too complex action scenes to follow. It could be well focused like this trailer, and then it would have been much better.",5
"Kya tatti movie thi 
Shahrukh act very average villan was thakela no sense of humour no feel good factor comedy

"" we don't have movies, we have  family.""  Definitely a Hollywood blockbuster moment.",5
"It Was Good No Cap, But I love This Trailer Lol",5
"My only issue with the movie were the multiple flashbacks, which seemed very unnecessary.  Other than that, I felt that the plot was compelling.  The agents basically gaslighting Neo into thinking that the events of the original trilogy were just his creative process when developing The Matrix video game.

BTW The Matrix: The Path of Neo, was an amazing video game.  If any game deserves to be remastered, it's that one.",5
Yes. Honestly I had the same feeling so I never watched it till it's 3rd season. It's so good,5
So awesome how the Seinfeld show is actually about nothing. It was the whole idea behind it and i love the show.,5
Wow this aged like milk lmao,5
Bollywood makes such meaningful movies without the excessive nudity other countries use to gather interest. And the actions is also better than a lot of western movies.,5
"Seinfeld is great, millennials have a hard time getting it or thinking Jerry is funny or something but I think he’s hilarious and the show was usually just joke after joke, one comedy bit after another, it’s a back and forth kind of thing. It’s genius",5
I love the part where Joe Pesci says 'you  think I'm funny ' and Dom answer  'no I think your family'. So inspiring .,5
Ok from the comments the movie was absolute garbage sooooo I'm just gonna appreciate this awesome trailer and move on with my life without a trashy sequel destroying my image and memories of how great the original was,5

Imagine being swooped into a series of this magnitude that blesses you with a emotional heart felt experience. Family .. loving.. and worthy of watching the whole series out of surprise how it would end.. My wife and I had the blessed experience to be drawn into a super emotional experience.. The cast was perfect.. The narrative had us on holding back tears.. but they escaped into laughter and back to tearful compassion on a different level. This will be my only post because this series was needed in a world where we see Grammy's handed out in praise but it touches the hearts of millions who can relate.. You won my household award for a collective production of life as it should be..❤❤❤❤,5
This and force awakens are two of the best ever. Trailers better than the movies unfortunately. Hope  a Matrix Tv series can save it.,5

"Great example of awesome trailer, not so awesome movie.",5
"It wasn't just about the action. It's about everything. Plot was decent, but everything else was mediocre at best. It just felt like a generic movie and didn't have the feel of ""The Matrix"".",5
"You have to know Bhuddishm, Numerology and the basics of Zoroastrian dualism to say you even watched matrix Resurrections. A genius level event so alienating to its audience it won’t be seen as a masterpiece that it is for years to come.

Absolutely loved matrix resurrections. I got no qualms with it whatsoever. As the worlds biggest matrix fan I have watched the original 78 times (yes I counted) it changed my life, it forced me to question my own reality and it made me love movies as my favourite personal interest. This movie is so sincere and exquisite in writing, subtext, allegories, performances etc. I love it for what it is. Any matrix film requires the viewer to upgrade their mindset and to watch it with clarity and vigilance. 
This film is no different. Like the original it gave me that feeling of reawakening. Rediscovering something for the first time like love or reuniting with an old friend. 
The film is a beautiful experience and one of the best sci-fi love stories ever committed to film. The visual storytelling on display here is excellent. 
The biggest irony for me is that the original changed the game, it’s influence on technology, media, culture, etc,it was a critical and commercial success.  
The pedigree of the original is unparalleled. What’s interesting is that over twenty years later the next instalment is ridiculed, panned, dismissed as nothing more then a sleazy cheap cash grab right? Everyone who didn’t like the film are all saying the exact same thing. Financially the film flopped too. If there’s one thing I know about this franchise is that every film was made with precision, meticulously crafted, it’s no accident or mistake that resurrections is considered a flop. That was the whole point! However if you take the red pill, adjust your mindset and rewatch this film again, you’ll see how deep the rabbits a-hole really goes.",5
"Haven't you noticed this whole dynamic is an homage to the great comedy teams... Kramden and Norton, Laurel and Hardy, Martin and Lewis, and mostly like you said.. Abbott and Costello

Comedy, as in the rest of all things in life is based on its foundation. 

This show worked so well because Seinfeld and David are such students of the comedy craft",5

I don't think so
I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air

Well, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared

I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said, ""Fresh"" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought ""Nah, forget it, yo, holmes to Bel Air""

I pulled up to the house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie, ""Yo holmes, smell ya later""
I looked at my kingdom
I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-Air",5
I had such high hopes for this movie -- WOW -- and it turned out to be complete garbage.,5
Great trailer for a great movie.,5
Great global actors love the movie India finest ❤❤❤❤❤,5
"Great trailer, fantastic film. I'll never understand why so many people were so down on the movie.",5
"I love the part where the most  liked comment says "" i'm the bald guy "" and Toretto says ""i'm the bald family"" Truly an most liked comment.",5
"I love the part where Thor says ""bring me Thanos"" and Toretto says ""he's nothing compared to my family"" Truly an inspiring scene. Deffo mtv award worthy

Edit: 100 likes on somethin I typed half asleep!! Lmao",5
It's hilarious. I've only watched it for two days and about 15 episodes of season 1 but it is great.,5
"People came here to type ""I love part......""

But I would say that I love this franchise 🎉",5
"While it would be nearly impossible to replicate the successes of the original trilogy, I still think Resurrections was a unique way of continuing the story. Still a far more creative installment than Revolutions.",5
"It's brilliant that a show about nothing, is one of the most loved sitcoms of all time.... Anyone who isn't aware of Seinfeld or a fan, must be confused!😅",5
"loved this part. Actually, I love all Seinfeld parts that are witty, intelligently silly and/or subtle. Sitcoms don't have to be just funny, without any intelligent joke in them, and Seinfeld delivers aplenty on this very thing, which is why it did so well... among other things...",5
"on the other hand this was one of the most funny trailers i've ever seen for a comedy show, so they wouldn't even need free episodes for me :D",5
"Truly believe if WB gave Lana time rather than rushing it into production, this would’ve been a worthy sequel. Hints of a fantastic film in the first half. In saying that, this trailer absolutely blew me away when I first saw it",5
THIS 4TH PART OF THE SAGA DIDN'T DISAPPOINT AT ALL!!!!! MASTERPIECE!!!!!! THE COHERENCE WITH THE WHOLE CONCEPT SINCE THE 1ST MOVIE 1 IS AMAZING!! WATCH IT!!!!,5
Ok?... but yes I agree  with you first 2 episodes free. Allow people to have their opinion,5
 @OmnipotentEnt  I still say that the 2003 mini series is the best of all. I will not revisit the 2024 part 2 at all. In my opinion it is unsatisfactory & had they wanted to do Dune justice it should have been done in 3 parts.,5
Oh my god what a movie.... brilliant story telling...a delight to the eyes.....how the man in earth can write this kind of story .....LOVE FROM INDIA.....,5
"I watched this dubbed ages ago in my country and this is my first time watching the original opening in English. Now that I can compare the two versions, the Italian version of the song was an absolute masterpiece and the voice actor Edoardo Nevola at that time did a incredibly good job rapping his part. It was even crazier (but still cool) than the original.",5
"Ahh yes, making it relevant to modern times was DEFINITELY a game changer. As if we don't have enough movies that show that already and goes against what made it special in the first place. As for Trinity on the same level as Neo, it felt pretty underwhelming, I mean Neo being the One was hyped up for 3 movies, and now, out of nowhere, this 1 movie came out and all of a sudden, Trinity is now like Neo.",5
" @adad3487  Lol, true story. David and Johnny do share the same eyebrows :)",5
Maybe bc they wanted to show stories ab women who can think for themselves instead of following men blindly? Idk. I know nothing ab the books but this right here was good story telling to me bc it showed how some ppl justify their hunger for power by calling it love.,5
It's time for Hollywood to introduce best trailer award!!! Don't know how many times I came back to see this......,5
"yes, power is more important to him than love.",5
"I couldn’t agree more, my thing was how they keep resurrecting people like nothing, I thought Jason performance was pretty cool, and the laws of nature are thrown out the window lol",5
I love the park where Dom’s crew said “we need gas” and then Dom says “we have family”. mtv movie awards worthy,5
"I was lured into this series with Eugene Levy and Katherine O'hare  .  I got addicted to this show after the first episode, A very eccentric comedy with a load of kooky, funny, eccentric well blended actors.  Chris Elliot is off the wall at his best.  Newcomer Annie Murphy is outrageous.   Dan Levy is in your face hilarious. 
My favorite is the ultra dry humor, cute and grungy tomboy  Emily Hampshire as Stevie Budd.",5

"I'm just going to say 1 thing. I can respond with hundred but just one. I am a ""HUGE"" Matrix film series fan. I remember watching the 1st one in 1999 up until the recent one. Nevertheless, there is a reason why Matrix Resurrections was giving a abysmal 5.7IMDB rating while the 1st Matrix was not only given a profound ""8.7"" imdb rating but considered Top 100 movie of ""all time""",5
What an awesome show! Love it.,5
"So many movie today seem to be created, not with a engrossing and coherent story, but to create great scenes to put in a trailer. This was one of them.",5
"Love this series, it's amazing. Here's a short summary:
Alexis: says ""David"" and asks if things are ""cute""
David: responds to everything by holding back a laugh
Moira: slurs big words in a strange accent
Johnny: mimes a surprise prostate exam at the punchline to every joke",5
"Hands down, one of the best movies I've ever watched... What a masterpiece! 👏",5
No words for this brilliant masterpiece also double respect and fan of srk🗿❤love from nepal,5
"I watched this in IMAX and then in 70mm for my birthday, and damn, was it a beautiful cinematic experience and worth watching in a theater, especially in 70mm. I didn't even want to see it again not in that format, but I went back and saw it in just regular theaters one more time before it leaves. For the 70mm we were so cramped in that theater it was packed nearly full, but seeing it with everyone's, everyone's reactions to what was happening, gasps and people sitting up on the edge of their seats, it was just a beautiful experience and what I think we should be cultivating more of in storytelling and cinema. Denis is keeping it alive.",5
"Try to read the books or get a GPT-condensation/summary of the books - don't watch this movie or part 2 first!
The first one of 78 was halfway good, the movie ""Jodorowskies Dune"" explains, why the 78-version was not realy entirely good; 
Dune 21 is halfway decent and ok, but lacks some content and story, Part 2, this one: Don't do it, you might be dissapointed, but do it for your own oppinion - which i am happy to hear",5
"To anyone who's thinking whether to watch this show or not, I say, don't waste another minute and get right to binging this show because it's brilliant and absolutely hilarious. It's got everything: humour, emotions, relationships. Such clever writing and it's gotta be one of the most relatable family relationships ever to be portrayed. Hope this helps!

I'm happy this show is finally getting the recognition it deserves.",5
"Despite the compelling  trailer I'm proud of myself for not watching this. I can't undo watching Revolutions and Resurrection but at least Resurrection had something of an ending, an exit point. But really The Matrix should have been a single one and done movie. Keanu fricking flies perfect ending what happens next is up to your imagination",5
"Great movie, but it truly needed Lawrence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving, please include them in future Matrix Movies/Shows etc",5
This show will gain even more traction now following the awards. 6 more season's PLEASE!!!,5
This is the best and perfect movie to see with all this hyped up talk about the Eclipse. lol,5
"This was much better than the first movie, powerful antogonists driving the plot. The first time I saw it, I thought I recognized Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, just something familiar about him. Then I realized, Jesse Eisenberg. I thought his portrayal was inspired and genius. When I learned it was Austin Butler, I couldn't believe how similar they both look with no hair... freakin weird man... like twins.",5
"A French movie should happen and they should honor Matthew Perry, even though the show will never be the same without him and the entire cat was 10 best season and if we happen to watch a movie in the future, that would be great",5
"I think the movie was good because of the story was good. And also I have appreciated that the movie was not a total shot’em up.
Music was also good but not as the same level of the first. Talking about that, Matrix expired a lot my creations. If you want to try some good Cyberpunk music, smash the Vampire teeth!",5
"Love, Love, Love this show. It’s hilarious 😂 .",5
" @lazaf3848  good for you, I'm not hating. We all like what we like",5
"I've been traveling cross country in my RV so I missed it when it came out. I saw the 1st in theater and I was blown away saw this one on my 52'' TV. Not the same of course but what an amazing movie.
I enjoyed being lost in the world, the costume, the music, the acting, everything was amazing. I know it got flack from those who read the book, I haven't, probably why I liked it.
I look forward to seeing the conclusion of this story.",5
"The only thing I regret about watching this film, is that I didn’t watch it in the cinema. It’s a masterpiece I hope is brought back to cinemas so I can see it on the big screen. 😭 I loved it so much",5
"Thank you, and i love you, Grace Slick =)",5
"i use to love watching this trailer when i use to get high lmao.

Look the movie did have some great concepts. IMO lacks focus with all of its potential it unfortunately falls on its face and should have been way better fight/shooting scenes BUT this is a awesome trailer,5
"I love the part where Nicole Kidman says , I just remember I liked you. And Dom says What, I love my family.",5
Luckyyyyyy. I had to keep putting it off bc ive been so busy but i finally watched it last night and wish i could go back for more but its probably the last week it’ll be in theaters. Movie is SO good!,5
I love the part that these started as being racing movies and now they are unhinged LOL. I’ll still go see them all tho,5
It is best so well that good well best so well best so well. It is best so well that good so well it.,5
I love this movie. My favorite character is Neo,5

The trailer honestly does no justice to what would be in store once you start watching this show. ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT.,5

They are starting to ruin one of my favorite stories of all times. They did not stick to the original story line at all. Focused more on his girl then on the main character. And they neglected to show the original fight seen. He destroyed the harconen not the other way around as was shown in the final fight seen. Great graphics is pretty much all I can say. If the 3rd part does not get back to its original story line I doubt many true fans of the book will call it a good movie. The first one was great. I can not say the same for the second part. They will destroy this movie just like they did to the Dark Tower movie. because of the graphics I give it a 9. but because they did not stay true to the story including the fact that his lets call her wife received more attention and they changed her character completely from agreeing with him all the way and giving her a role that was never mentioned in the books it drops down to a. I am so dissapointed. The best on screen version of this series was the sci fi channel series.,5
"Masterpiece of a movie, one of the best science fiction stories ever told on paper and now on film. Every aspect of these films was crafted with precision and care",5

"Fast X is amazing movie, i loved it",5
"I really love this franchise growing up with it i understand how important a true friendship is because the actors have been acting together for 20 years and they have the same relationship in the reality . I don’t understand why people are anoyed with this family thing because this is how the film been from the begining. I know it was too much in the last two movies and some scenes were a little bit ridiculous but you need to understant that they had to change the structure of the film because you can’t have the same structure every film . I love that they kept the little things until now , like the barbecues , the car races, the importance of the family. I didn’t enjoy that much Fast 9 because for me it was too much and they exaggerated at some point with Roman and Tej going to space .I have just seen Fast X and i can say i liked it . I didn’t like three aspect : the negative character , i know they wanted to have comedy too but this why you have Roman and the negative character should be a real badass , i mean you had jason statham in the past as a villan and you go to Jason Momoa , i didn’t like him in this movie to be honest. Two , i really want to see vin diesel hurt , a little scratch on his car or i don’t know he jumps from a fucking plane and his car doesn’t have a scratch , i want the actions to be more realistic and Dom to be human . Three i want to have more car races in this one was only one and it hits you really hard with that nostalgia . The end wasn’t like a regular end in their style because it is going to be 2 more parts so i understant that they want to keep that enthusiasm . I really appreciate the work comint from the cast and producers and they should get more respect . Another thing I’m glad with is that it is the #1 movie in the world right now . Much love to Fast and Furious the greatest franchise for me",5
I absolutely love this show. Kept putting off watching it. Decided to binge watch with the bf because nothing else was on. So glad we did. One of my absolute favorite shows.,5
So it’s a show about a bunch of Hollywood liberalish rich people slumming it in a small town. Is it any surprise the insanely rich Hollywood limousine liberal class gave this an Emmy — they watch it and see themselves then they award what flatters themselves,5

"Now this is a story all about how
My life got flipped, turned upside down
And I'd like to take a minute
Just sit right there
I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air
In West Philadelphia born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out, maxin, ' relaxin' all cool
And all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said, ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air""
I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket
I put my Walkman on and said, ""I might as well kick it""
First class, yo this is bad
Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass
Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?
Hmm, this might be alright
But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois and all that
Is this the type of place that they should send this cool cat?
I don't think so, I'll see when I get there
I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air
Well, uh, the plane landed and when I came out
There was a dude looked like a cop standing there with my name out
I ain't tryna get arrested yet, I just got here
I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared
I whistled for a cab and when it came near
The license plate said ""fresh"" and it had dice in the mirror
If anything I could say that this cab was rare
But I thought, ""Nah, forget it, yo, holmes, to Bel-Air""
I pulled up to a house about seven or eight
And I yelled to the cabbie, ""Yo, holmes, smell ya later""
Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there
To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air",5

"Watched Dune 2 this week-end, and I left the theater very pleased. Absolute masterpiece!",5
Quite frankly I thought part 1 was way better. There just seemed to be something lacking. in part 2. Where were the pulse weapons and the weirding way found in the book and where was his sister Aliyah? I know the books are usually better than the movies but this just seemed to be lacking something. I still think the 2000 TV inseries overall was and is the best. The story sticks close to the books; the cinemetography is immaculate and it is well acted.,5

Dune 2 is an atmoshperic sequel that is even better than the first Dune. The directing style of Denis Villeneuve allows the actors to look convincing in their roles. The film has great visuals and action scenes. Unmissable.,5
"I just watched this great movie yesterday before I went to sleep and let me tell you something, the hype for this movie is very much real. It's one of the best movies I've seen in a while and I was impressed for once. Being a Dune fan, I had high expectations for the first movie which (probably mostly because I wasn't paying enough attention) felt really slow and boring.

But this gem stood out and was completely different from the first movie. I loved everything from the beautiful story to the acting to the action scenes. Everything flowed perfectly together from beginning to end. 

If I were to nitpick on something, it would be more variation, as most of the movie focuses on Paul and the Fremen in the desert. It got tedious at times and I felt that the movie lacked story in-depth. Nonetheless, I still felt the movie did a good job focusing on the Harkonnens and their situation as well. Feyd was especially a pleasant surprise, as he was very badass, to say the least. His ruthlessness and coldbloodedness can't be denied to the point even I was surprised by his zero tolerance.
 
All in all, this movie is a masterpiece. A 10 out of 10. I actually played Dune II, my favorite RTS game of all time right before watching Dune Part II so that should tell you how much I love this series, whether it's the games or the movies.

So yeah, if you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it because you won't be disappointed!",5

"I am a huge fan of The Matrix ever since first released, and the books too, I had no idea this was being released, I saw like 1 video of Trinity and Neo on a bike in a city for like a small promotion that they were shooting for it... That was IT.  I believe y'all should have used like 2 or 3 mil more on avertisements, but, how on earth does one create a movie costing 160 million? I mean hiring great CGI people with simple AI now, and some time, you can do it for 5 million FOR SURE. Not to mention all the money it would generate from using more advertising... Because I was totally out of the loop together with all the people I know of when it would actually be released.",5
Tb sirf blockbuster hota all time blockbuster nhi hota all time industry hit nhi hota,5
" @NeoConnor1  I agree. I mean, it's not perfect, but it's still good. And given how Revolutions ended, I think this is as close as a happy ending we can get in this universe.",5
"Fun fact 100% of the comments are, "" I love the part"" 😅",5
its simply eccentric but I had good time pass watching it.. It's so simple but it is  good.. if you watch first episode you definitely binge watch this.. something catch ..,5
"Fabulous, I cried, I laughed, I loved it!",5
for a second I thought this was serious it's just a little mini compilation of a bunch of different movies from these actors LOL you almost got me I was going to say the worst thing he could possibly do is something like this LOL LOL,5
"Yes, it gets better with every season. There is a big turning point at the end of the second season and it just gets better and better from there.",5
"I love the part where Thanos says ""I'm inevitable"" and Dom says ""I'm family"". The best scene ever created in the history of mankind.",5
"I adore Schitt's Creek, it's a masterpiece and it's meant to heal hearts",5
"But that's the whole point of the film.

You've got that bit at the beginning where Smith says ""Our evil overlords at Warner Brothers want to make a sequel to the trilogy with or without us, we might as well profit off it"" and then Neo and his team spend the next ten minutes going ""Yeah, we can't make anything as good as the original Matrix trilogy, times have changed, audiences have changed, this is just a cynical cashgrab""

Lana knew there wasn't a chance of a good Matrix 4, so she took the money and the opportunity to give her characters a happy ending so that Warner Brothers wouldn't want to milk the series further.

Unfortunately, there's a new Matrix film announced by Drew Goddard, so Lana basically wasted her time.",5
"It's not as bad as I'd expected. Kept my interest, I was glad I gave it a chance.",5
"Was fricking amazing, shame how Jakob went but he had some great scenes! Loved seeing Jason Statham again, cannot wait til 2025 to see how things went for him.",5
"Ha ha ha! Not Mandela effect, just the original extended version.",5

Not movies like JAWAN promoting important social messages",5
Superb acting! The cast was perfect! Everyone fit's their roles perfectly! I'm in love with this show. No dull moments.,5
I agree this doesn’t scratch the surface of this hysterical gem honestly S1 wasn’t the funniest season. As with most series it takes time to mature.,5
"if this movie is what you think dragging it out is, then I sure hope they keep doing it until Dune 10 lmao",5
"the trailer is so badd, they basically told the entire plot of the pilot 😭
the show is great though so please watch it :D",5
"I love the part when Peter Clemenza said “Leave the gun, take the Cannoli”, and Dom said “Leave Dante, take the Family”. Truly amazing scene",5
"There is a parody quality in this movie. I'm not sure if it's intentional. It's as if it makes fun of the original trilogy without really taking the story any further. It's almost like a parallel story that borrows blocks from the original and plays with them rather than producing something progressive and original. I get the whole ""meta"" thing they wanted to do but I dont think it worked well. I expected at least some inventive visual effects, like the bullet scenes in the trilogy, but that is also absent. It's almost cartoonish... I wonder what would a director like Christopher Nolan would have done with it. A missed opportunity to make something great.",5
This movie was absolutely amazing! And watching it in IMAX just made it even better. One of my most favorite sci fi movies of all time. I wish Frank Herbert was here to see that his best selling worldwide books made it into movies. Love this movie and by far better than the first. 💯💯💯,5
Well ofcourse people were waiting for srk to come on big screen so yes and SRK's acting also made film nice,5
Yes Guys I Love Fresh Prince Songs,5
I must say muad’dib riding the worm was my favorite scene and how it affected Chani and Stilgar fit their characters. For chani is was pride relief and excitement all rolled into one. For stilgar he is literally watching prophecy come true before his very eyes and looks overwhelmed. Not confirmation of decades of belief but stunned and overwhelmed at the same time. Just spectacular. You can almost feel this is what riding the controlling a giant worm would feel like and look like and it just so happens to be the biggest one anyone has ever seen.,5
"I love the part where stone cold Steve Austin says ' WHAT?', and dom replys ' family'. Truly a masterpiece of a scene",5
"Dom 😡: Winning used to be about winning. We raced for respect. Today I race to stop the blood bath. 

Aquaman 🧜‍♂️🤬: That’s the problem with having a big family. How do you choose the ones you save!",5
"The majority of comments all start with I love, or Love. Just bots repeating the same thing everywhere.",5
"One of the best, witty, funny well written comedies I’ve ever seen!",5
This movie was so slow but it was good im intrigued with the future of dune and im glad im witnessing it,5
The fact that this show stars Dan and Eugene Levy is so brilliant - they are amazing and hilarious.    The whole cast is phenomenal and so funny. Such a great show - bingeworthy.,5
 @varenik02  🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️ God bless u ... We all love SRK sir..and thanks again,5
"Abit strange having some of the original cast but not others.

Especially Morpheus and Smith. 

Hugo Weaving was amazing at playing Smith.. so to not see him again sucked.

Myself like many others loved the og Smith.",5
"Well I finally watched the movie, Yes it started off awkward for the first 30 to 40 minutes.

But it did progress and it got better and the ending was pretty damn good in my opinion.",5
"The concept was good, however after just watching it, it’s obvious to me that millennial minds, over-compromising, and time constraints, along with current events played a huge part in the way the film turned out. I was able to appreciate it by using my imagination though. I could see that there was a real vision trying to play out here as perfectly as the trilogy, but it just seemed like there were too many unneeded and unnecessary cooks in the kitchen on this one, in pretty much every area.
I wish that, when doing something as grandiose as the Matrix 4, that they would only hire the EXACT cast and crew that made and directed the trilogy. Bringing in new minds and new ideas to interject, edit, and basically rewrite such an already perfect classic production piece just ruins it. The audience wants the same feel of the first 3 films. The same look of the first 3 films. The same pace as the first 3 films. The same ACTION as the first 3 films. It’s a continuation, not a reproduction. There in lies the rub, because it looks like they were trying to do both. This movie had SO much potential. If only they wouldn’t have tried so hard. 4/10.",5
"I love the part where Martin Luther King says ""I have a dream"" and Dom responds ""and I have a family"". Truly inspiring moment.",5
Homegirl needed 20 mins and came up with the third best song by a dude who’s not even the second best musician in his family,5
"(If you haven't seen the movie, then Spoilers, I guess) So, we all now know that Neo's business partner is actually Smith, so how awesome would it have been if the trailer ended the same, with him saying ""after all this time, going back to where it all started, back to the Matrix"" but it was Hugo Weaving. I believe he was doing a theater production at the time, but whether you like the movie or not, it would have been so much better if Weaving had come back to play Smith.",5
"I just finished this show today and I'm in shambles. I was very depressed when I first started watching it, but it gave me the little laughter I needed. We all know how the world could use that. A little goes a long way. Needless to say, this show made me feel emotions I haven't felt in a long time. Emotions I was afraid to. Amongst all the laughter, I found myself learning lessons and being reinforced them throughout the show. It made me feel so much happiness, sadness, and everything in the middle all at once. So many wonderful things can really disguise itself in humor. Just like the Rose family, I was feeling really lost at the time. Graduating High School during Covid was a huge set back for me. And I ended up in a personal situation of my own I thought was impossible to overcome. But just like the Rose family, at the very end, I found myself somewhere. Somewhere special. And I've learned to be independent so this show has become very special to me. We never know what God has in store for our lives. And it's never too late to start a new chapter. I hope one day, I look back on these words, and remember just how precious these times were. Just like how there are better days ahead. This series really teaches you, that no matter how far the set back, you can always pick yourself up. And I find it so inspiring to look within and see how ""big"" the ""little"" things really are. I was homeless just like them, feeling like there was nowhere to turn to. But I found my place now. I found myself now. And you can only look forward. Thank you Schitt's Creek for being a part of my own personal journey. This show truly was something special. And I've been afraid of discovering something like that for a long time, but it only shows how beautiful life can be. If you have nothing you're afraid of losing, you have nothing to gain. And as much as I didn't want this show to end, I know it only means a bigger door is only opening. Much love to you all.

After watching the movie feel the story needs to have a stronger plot. Kudos to vfx and action sequences but more research and character buildup needs to happen. Hope they do better in part two since I hope part two comes and they keep improvising,5
"It's too bad that this trailer was far more interesting than the movie ever was. It was mediocre at best, when the first part was an amazing adaptation of the source material.",5
:) Thanks for sharing that. I loved it too.,5
"1:41 I really love that soundtrack!! 👏👏👏👏👏

1:50 And say, this part of it sounds like a part from that old Transformers game:
''TRANSFORMERS: Fall Of Cybertron''",5
"I've only just discovered Schitts Creek😮 how is that possible you may say ! Well I have only just subscribed to Nettyflix ( as I like to call it) Come on folks, give me a break, after all I am 72 years old 😊
The acting is exceptional, I have a secret crush ( not so secret now) On Dan Levy and I'm not even gay 😮 ( well perhaps just a little bit)
I need my ""fix"" of Schitts Creek every day, I also only just realised that Moira Schitt is played by the incredible actress Catherine O'Hara who I remember from Beetlejuice ( Dayo oh! Dayo) 😅
Thanks for posting this insight into the show
Love from Dayy vid 😅 from the U.K. 🇬🇧🇬🇧🇬🇧",5
I also loved this movie. My favorite song from this movie was my city. Jakob isn't necessarily dead I mean they brought Han back so why not Jakob. It's a shame though that Paul Walker hasn't been with us for almost 10 years,5
I didn't watched this amazing show for so long just because of not-so-good trailer until my friend made me watch first 2 episodes. Then I was hooked 😌,5
Loved it. I just saw it 3 days ago . thank you so much warner ... Please go for the 5 as well PLEASEEEEE make the it,5
"Great trailer, but compared to the original trilogy, some things are better left in the past.",5
"Dune part two is my best theater experience.
Timothée is Priceless Hollywood is lucky to have a Actor like him.
I love the fact people who don't know Timmy after watching Dune part two see his interviews 
How this is guy even Paul Muad'Dib Atreides Duke of Arrakis LISAN AL GAIB 🤔
He's so cute and soft and sweet and adorable goofball 😍 

That's what is Amazing Unique about Timothée he becames his Cinema Characters by heart and soul 

That CMBYN Oscar snub this time will be in the rightful hand.
It has to Dune part two and A Complete Unknown
in a year
That Academy Award Nominee Will soon be Academy Award Winner Timothée Chalamet. 👑❤",5
340 million dollars movie and there are almost 1 billion people struggling the life which made me watch it for free from some crazy website but with an empty laptop so it dose not matter if anyone hacks it lol hahahaha freedom of free fast furious  hahahahaha same story again and again and again and again hahahahahahaha,5

A masterpiece for you is Godzilla X Kong lmao.,5
"Most comments starts with ""I love the part where ..."" Are all of you running out of words ? Little of creation please ! The comment section is a big source for me for learning english 🙃",5
i love at 1:10 how the license plate says fresh and has the dice in the mirror --- gross!!!!,5
I don't even care what anyone said about this movie I actually really enjoyed it it was everything I wanted in Matrix film and more super relatable too I loved how they made Neo basically a game developer in the Matrix world compared to the real world actually so cool to me,5
"I love when a ""I love"" comment is the only joke 15000 people have",5
"The interval between 1.07 and 1.24 is really great and it's the climax. It gives you the goosebumps. It's perfect. Overall the trailer is perfect. Like everyone else said, the trailer is way ahead of the movie.",5
I feel like I can jump straight to season 2 now thanks to this huge trailer!,5
"I loved the part where Dr. House says ""It's Lupus"" and Dom says ""No, it's Family"". Truly, a cinematic masterpiece. What a scene!",5
I wanted to watch it but then forgot iam just now coming back to this movie lol was it good?,5
Oooo i absolutely love this show. And i just love David Rose character so much.,5
"This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time!  It's so brilliantly clever and perfectly cast, written, and performed!!!!",5
"I know nothing ab the books, they are hard to read but i loveeeee the movies and i never want them to end even tho i know they will😢 Love the cast. Just spot on. Havent seen a trilogy this epic since LOTR honestly",5
"I Love Love Loved this show, however, I never cared for Chris Elliot in anything. Schitts Creek is no exception.  JMO.",5
"I'm not really into sitcoms, but I started watching it out of intrigue and boy, am I glad I did. This show totally surprised me in the best way possible, and I am gonna miss it 100%.",5
Such an amazing and funny show. Honestly by the end of season 6 I was in love with all the characters. Seeing how much they’ve improved with all the other characters is amazing,5
The trailer is awesome!! 😁 I can't wait to start watching it on Tubi! I just downloaded the app only to see this! My friend keeps telling me to watch it so now that I've seen the trailer am sold!! 😂🙈,5
"This is one of the few shows where the finale should be watched first. The stress of watching several seasons to find out how they escaped is alleviated. It perks the curiosity of what happened which lures you into watching the series. The entire casting is brilliant and Catherine O'Hara portrayal of Moira is so good that you are left questioning if she is acting or not. Over time you will come to love each character and appreciate 
the actors portrayal of them.",5
Jawan1 All Time Blockbuster But Jawan2 All Time Mega Blockbuster ❤❤❤.,5
"Well done! Definitely looks like more of a drama for this “movie version” haha. Oh, how I wish this was really happening!!",5
"Interesting. I know muslims believe and are waiting for the arrival of Mahdi. A men from the lineage of Prophet who will establish justice on the earth and bring peace globally. 

The movie is 11/10 

Фильм пушка",5
"This masterful trailer gave me so much hope in the movie, I love the this Universe so much. Then I saw the movie...enough said.",5
"I saw this movie last week and I gotta say, besides Deadpool and Wolverine I think this will be Warner Bros’ year! GxK, Joker 2 in a few months and now this! Three masterpieces in a year from a company I didn’t think could pull it off, good job guys!",5
Excellent action! Jason did his thang in this movie🎬 Loved all the twist and turns!,5
"I really wanted to love it... the first movie was great, unfortunately that one was too long and boring... hopefully, the third will be better.",5
So far This movie had impressed many indians who thinks bollywood is finished including me also but i hope they doesn't do some stuff like Adipurush and come out with part 2 of Astraverse Franchise with more impact and high quality content,5
thanks bro. much love. <3,5

Hahaha right !!! And the music played by piano ! TEARS!!!!,5
"Movie that should have been made in 2010 so much seriousness and intense, also feel like they don't make movies like this very often nowadays. By far the best I've seen in a long time, don't feel like belong in this era.",5
Yes I'm back babysitting The 1st sequel to this is really good it's real old like these games folk play I used the 1st movie in my time line in 2018 2017  i fill sorry 4 u folk in my next projects whenever that is 🙏🍼😟😁🗝️🤣😂,5

" @NoodleNemesis  I watched adipurush, kalki. Kalki is also good but this cinema has superb vfx❤️ content wise kalki is better ❤️",5
Loved the movie! it was really good ❤,5
"As someone who worked in Sudan for many years, this series and the books that it is rooted in, is unashamedly about Arabs, their culture, heroes, and their experiences of colonialism, great power tussles, and the struggle for their resources (oil is pithily presented as ""spice"" for example). I only wish that peoples from the lands that inspired Dune were included as actors, script writers, and consultants. Many of the names and concepts that are descriptive of awe inspiring elements like the ""eyes of Ibad"" and ""shai hulud"" and the ""mahdi"" are mispronounced, even if they are placed in a historical context that is basically correct. I hope they draw more on the indegenous cultures and peoples in the next series. But a must watch nonetheless.",5
I may be living physically in 2025 but in my mind i am still living in this best marvel era... From 2013 to 2019...,5
"I love the part when the comment sections says ""i love the part"" and the part the trailer shows the whole movie.......man cant wait to see the movie i wonder whats gonna be in it 😂😂😂",5
"Aaaaaah.... Billions of people who didn't understand the message of a Matrix film... 

Feeling like the history repeats itself 

The Matrix Resurrections is indeed a Masterpiece and if you truly love the first film/ trilogy I think you should try and think again.",5
This is amazing! My wife made me watch it and as soon as Dans character was on I couldn’t stop.  He is a great actor.  They all are.  What a funny show about life!🤣,5
"I love the part where Indiana Jones says to Dom, “give me the whip” and then Dom says “give me my family”. Truly amazing",5
"Well, it didn't ruin the other films. Matrix 1 is still a great classic, and 2 and 3 were decent sequels. We can just forget about Part 4, hehe...",5
Cast many mixed black men and black men without black women for the 20th time 🤷🏽‍♀️… thanks for the true diversity FF franchise!,5

"Funny, entertaining, silly and heartwarming with well-paced character development and a diverse cast of characters that never feels forced like in modern shows. I am experiencing wokeness-fatigue right now, instinctively rejecting every show that attempts to preach to me about political ideals, forced inclusivity and trying to guilt-trip me into supporting the x ideal or the x hatemongering party. Yet this show is the one exception, diversity and inclusivity done right. LIKEABLE characters that are GOOD HUMAN BEINGS first, THOUGHTFUL people second and x race or sexuality THIRD, plus romance is a side plot and not the pivotal point of the cop series.  

Just trust me and don’t watch the final season, season 8. The show gets hit by the BLM protests taking place during the filming of season 8 and the entire season was rewritten into a gaslighting  propaganda fest to appease the raving media. Seasons 1 to 7 are great.",5
i recently discovered this and currently on season 6 things are about to end and i wish there had been more!! but this was sooooo good im glad i found it its been amazing 💯💗,5
i m fan of prabhas  n yash but i like this film VFX so much more then kalki n kgf  so I hope if it's part 2 came then it will heat the screen n will be a good movie,5
I just finished this series tonight. I am still crying. Watching them is like watching my family grow. Seeing every character matures makes me so proud of this masterpiece. I love everyone! My favorite tho are Alexis and Stevie. I need a spin off of this or else I will watch these 6 seasons over and over again.,5
"Oh, how I wish they would do a spin off. The cast was PERFECT. Loved them all.",5
its kind of low quality not because its old but its SSOOOO good like what?! 30 years later its still better then any theme songs ive seen-,5
 @FilmSpook  thank you so much for your support. Dude to the first few words u wrote that I read I'm now officially over it. Thank you so much for doing gods work helping people get over semi-real comments.,5
Dave Bautista as Yevgeny Prigozhin and Christopher Walken as Joe Biden  was excellent. If you get the points behind the scenes ...this is an excellent political movie,5
Dante^s wife ???... there must be the long list of women who want to act with Mr. Jason Momoa...  Mr. Vin Diesel x Mr. Jason Momoa look perfect on fast x banner... well done for fast x... God bless...,5

"It's a shame that nuclear weapons are associated with nuclear power, our best hope of slowing AGW without the ruinous sprawl of industrial wind turbines & solar panels invading open spaces. Developing huge tracts of land & sea goes against the roots of environmentalism. Nuclear (e.g. SMR) is far more compact & reliable than fickle wind towers or panels that only work during the day and presume miracle battery backup that probably won't happen at scale.",5
"Be sure to go back and watch the original David Lynch version of this movie, everyone, before you watch Part 2. Dune has achieved an extremely rare feat, indeed: It is one of the very few movies where the original and remake actually enhance the other, rather than take anything away from either like so many re-makes do. 

Watching one without the other is an incomplete experience.",5
you must be so fun at parties,5
Amazing movie ♥️♥️ really Ayan Mukherjee nd all the beautiful casts in the film  has done an excellent job ❤️ .... very nice loved it 👏🏻 keep it up ❤️,5
ye its more or less hit or miss for people. i really enjoyed it. thought it was amazing. lots of others thought it was trash. cool tho,5
"This has been the best Batman movie I have ever seen. Batman movies are adding more realistic styles rather than pure science fiction. Riddler has been portrayed as a legend in this movie. Batman is not just a character, it's a symbol - anyone could try to become one. But talking realistically I know one day a maniac like me will run the world down. Batman character itself is a great hope for me.",5

 Keanu Charles Reeves  I think when you put John with 4 and the matrix and BRZRKR  together and there is John wick 5 story begin after John wick die and he met God and God told him he was special he was  God Angel Michael but before that he was BRZRKR and he was attacked heaven before but there is a princess name Meledy she been trained so hard since a child for BRZRKR because her city called heaven is pretty much advanced and have a lot of precious things that we knew BRZRKR will come and by the way her name called meledylove and nice to meet you,5
"Again, thank you for this, best cinematic roller coaster ever, period.",5
WHY DID YOU REMOVE THE SCENE WHER EVERYONE BOWS TO TONY ITS A BEAUTIFUL SCENE BUT MAKING EVERYONE BOW MAKES IT 10000000% MORE BEAUTIFUL,5
" Keanu Reeves   sure Since the first Matrix in 1999 and the gift 2000 until now, My interest was more after John Wick in 2014,you are the best",5

"Thanks for your care, love and support towards my career...... Where are you from",5
Denzel's son may had played a more convincing role or better yet:  the  Dad.,5
"March 2025, but this movie will never die. It's climax for an epic storyline build for 11 years. Always come back here and get the same goosebumps. Hope the upcoming movies will match this masterpiece.",5
Well I can say I am so happy when Jesus Christ came on earth he came as a humble man on earth leaving all His glory aside. This movie seems another version of Greek Gods.,5
"Wanna to say - this chapter, perhaps, the best of franchise. Love it !!!",5
"Even 2025 but 0:15  seems like yesterday

Love you 3000❤😢😢

Please sports me iron man fens ❤❤❤😢😢😢",5
"The story and action scenes were perfectly awesome 
Loved the movie and would watch it again!!!",5
"It's 2024, this is one of the best trailers, and motivating films of all time.",5
2019 was one of the worst years in my life but going to the Cinema and watch this movie live was my highlight that year. What a great moment in my life.,5
"This movie will always be the greatest, with incredible hype and an unforgettable experience of all time. Everyone was really waiting for its release on that time. Remember the crowd in the cinema while we watching this masterpiece? I really miss the hype. what abt y’all?",5
All we can do is our best and sometimes the best we can do is coming back to the trailer.,5
I come and watch this masterpiece every month like it's my duty for my inner self to relieve the best era of world cinema.,5
Our own super hero movie...excellent...,5
"The fact that Steve still had that picture of Peggy, that hits different...
It proves that a truly loved her...
Yes I know I'm commenting on this trailer years after the movie came out I just like looking at past events to suffer nostalgia",5
Not this Batman. 😢I love the Justice league one,5
And now Robert is an academy award winner,5
"I saw this over the holidays. Honestly, this was just as good as Joker and Dark Knight, even better but no Oscar nods. Don't know why. This guy has potential for Oscar wins in the future too.",5
"Took the family to see this last night. Great job! A Hindi film I will definitely add to my collection :) Fun, Funny, and an emotional roller coaster-level ride!! Fantastic job with this movie.",5
"Just watched it today. The action, the cinematography, and the cast are just superb. The sudden deaths and CONSEQUENCES of John Wick's actions are truly shown in this masterfully directed film by Chad Stahelski. Just a MASTERPIECE! Truly up there with Mad Max: Fury Road. 11/10",5
"I love how they didn't do what terrible movies do by spoiling main events, they did well keeping it hidden",5
"Just watched it!  Greatest series (where every chapter was well told, equally as entertaining)!   I need the collector pack!",5
"May 4 2019 I went to 5 pm film session at my local cinema, brought a huge popcorn and enjoyed that masterpiece! Easy School days, and relatively peaceful world out there. I’m glad I was able to witness such an amazing movie!",5
I watched this movie today ..It was just amazing 😍...every characters was mind-blowing 🔥🔥🔥🔥.. hope this movie gonna be blockbuster 🔥🍿😎,5
Thank for your love care and support it’s my pleasure talking to you here where are you from?,5
"2:23
I'm sorry, but you cannot tell me this isn't the coolest thing like ever LOL",5
"I’m just writing down what I’m literally thinking now. This batman hopefully WAS just trained by Alfred, and he’s still this good. Just a better detective. What if the second movie, he travelled the world and became more refined! Comes back to Gotham with a new upbeat and confident attitude as Bruce, and as Batman he’s more about saving than revenge. I’m not sure who could take him on, but not Joker yet. Ra’s? Anyway this gives him a good reason to be more of a ninja lmao but also it plays more into the “I am the Night” than a “I am Vengeance” and that’s good for movie number two, as the old catchphrase goes. I hope they modify his suit too, to reflect that change in attitude. I think these ideas would get us to a closer more accurate Batman and we could finish off the trilogy with the last line “I am Batman” seeing him go through all his stages of being Batman lol, but also these ideas I think make justifiable sense from the first movie (like Bruce obviously being Batman, but switching his Bruce persona up a bit to disguise thag problem. It’s a movie too, I mean Batman travelling around the world and becoming the number one badass isn’t realistic prolly, but I wanna see it! I like where it’s going either way, but wouldn’t it be awesome to see Pattinson as a live action Arkham batman sort of lmfao idk I just want some badass fight scenes next time around. This guy is the peak of all humans, I wanna see it",5
We want strong Batman not weak like robert Pattinson one we know that DC and Marvel forgot how to make a good movie because both of them lost hope in their directors or script writers. Even Vfx can be made by small companies,5
"Amazing ....jus amazing... i am eager to watch the movie this weekend ☺

 So happy to see that at least bollywood is trying their level best .... people should appreciate their efforts rather than keep mocking, criticizing and  comparing it with  hollywood.....c'mon this is bollywood man.... there is huge diff between their budgets and technologies and ours...  we should support our movies instead of keep demeaning before hollywood movies...👍 
#Allthebest to team #Brahmastra and must say i have seen other clips also and i am amazed by #mouniroy's acting... 👌",5
"I don’t think I’ve ever seen the Dunning Kruger effect in the context of perceived intellectual superiority based on noticing that the dumb fun action flick isn’t realistic.

people must love you at parties",5
Peace and love ❤️✌️🤟,5
It's been with a heartfelt gratitude I wanna say thank you for your kind words.😊,5
"Best film ever !!! Keanu is my fave actor !!!
PURE TALENT and a nice guy x",5
Every marvel content looks mid now after this masterpiece,5
"I watched this movie. I agree we should support this kind of movie. Hey I thought of something. If god does something its always for a purpose or teach lesson. Maybe after they solve their family issues with Dev and Parvati.. Maybe a huge threat is going to destroy earth and this Aastra warriors will assemble and save earth like a Avenger movie. I can only imagine how it would look like>>A huge star cast movie with Hrithik,  Ayushmann, Vicky Kaushal, Riteish Deshmukh and others join to protect earth. And I hope they add better dilogy this time. How wish there is other 6-7 more BRAHMĀSTRA level astra. And Those mighty astras is wielded by our top popular actors. There could be other earth where the wielder of that earth's BRAHMĀSTRA comes to Ranvir's earth and teaches him to control and use BRAHMĀSTRA for good and they both together fight a dangerous villain who could be a popular foreign actor.",5
The trailer is gorgeous and Keanu is beautiful as always❤❤❤❤,5
"Just watched it. One of the best movies I ever watched. The visuals was amazing, the story was good, it was very refreshing to watch such a movie in bollywood. This movie set the bar too high. Y'all did a good job. Hats off.",5
"It's one of those scores that takes a really good movie to one that gives you goosebumps. 
Got really good character development with the Bat too, and I was pleasantly surprised by Pattinson. If you're a Batfan, don't miss it. If you're a Patfan, don't miss it. Hope they raise the bar even further with the next one. Can't comment without missing Ledger though RIP.",5
Peace and love 🤟❤️✌️,5
❤️Thanks for the endless love and support you have constantly shown me  in such difficult moment. I’m forever grateful. I really appreciate your unconditional love to me and every effort exerted by you to cause a change…Where are you watching from?,5
Excellent movie. 10/10 for me.  Best action movie.,5
probably the best trailer: A man has to look his best when it's time to get merried or burried :)),5
"The action scenes and choreography were phenomenal but what was also notable was Reeves' choppy dialogue lol; people in the cinema were laughing every time he talked. Yeah I get that he's a broken man but that doesn't change how choppy and generic his lines sound, like it's satire. Some of the other comments here would make you believe it's an Oscar worthy film; it's simply an amazing piece of choreography and some unreal stunts that give fairly unmatchable entertainment value.",5
"The trailers were great, but the film was below-average. Ben Affleck excelled as Batman in great films. While Robert Pattinson is a good actor, he doesn't quite suit this role.",5
" fardeenshorts786 as neither a fan of SRK or Salman, I can say that Pathan’s trailer was far more exciting and engaging than that of Tiger 3. Also, regardless of how good or bad an actor SRK is, he was superb in the action scenes. I am referring to his body language and expressions. Salman looks like a spent force in comparison.",5
Hes so jason statham like love it!🔥,5
"I didn't plan on watching this but went ahead bcs of positive reviews. I am in Canada and this movie was housefull on Sunday evening.  It is a good movie that could be global hit. My criticism- 1. Effects were too intense without any down time/ refractory period. Needed to be balanced out with down periods it was all up all the time too overestimulating. 2. Dialogues need a bit of polish work, srk's dialogues were cringe n would piss of global audiences bcos of fat shaming n other aspects. 3. Subtitles in English were literally translated n not good at all. Please work on this if u want global audiences n 500% more business. Thanks!",5
Wat great Ben Affleck was on lol he was terrible in bvs only big can fight that's alll no good dialougesss joke look 💩💩💩💩💩🖕🖕🖕🖕 In justice league he was cringe cringe cringe ur cringe as well woke man u💩💩💩🖕🖕🖕,5
"I just watched it for the second time ever last week after seeing it in the theaters.  It’s up there with Dredd and Blade Runner 2049 for me as far as theater experiences, the only way i describe them is spellbinding.

The depth of this movie is what makes it the best Batman.  Christopher Nolan took it there and the Dark Knight trilogy will stand alone, but this Matt Reaves rendition already set a tone that is already unmatched.  Robert Pattinson blew me away with his take on the tortured, isolative and emotionally stunted person the real Bruce Wayne would have had to be to be true to the character of an orphan child.  Some of the mannerisms were played a little too well it’s like authentic lyrics from a traumatized artist. 

I felt like this wasn’t dark just to be dark and it wasn’t trying to be colorful at all to live up to the hype, but still it was unrelenting in its depictions of the rich history of all the comics, the animated versions, and our real world, the comics are based on, especially right now with mental illness and public corruption coming to ahead. I am excited to see this version develop and really hope they work in the League of Shadows after the Joker in a nod to Nolan, and the immortal Ras lol.",5
The more I come to understand Batman. The more I realize Christian didn't really didn't show us the mental health of Bruce Wayne. They tried in DkR but Robert played it perfectly ❤,5
"When i heard that Robert Patisson will be the next Batman i was disapointed. But after i saw the movie..wow, he realy did it, he was great. And Colin Farrell also did it very good",5
Awesome Awesome ❤,5
"Hello to the people coming in when its 2050 and beyond, i hope you know that if you’re looking at this as a kid, just know that this was the epitome of childhood/cinematic experience for me and your elderlies. We will forever remember cheering in the cinema when cap picked up the hammer, when ironman snapped his fingers, when everyone came back through the portal. I hope everyone is well at this time, we truly shared something special",5
"Best john wick movie ever, so amazing",5
"I had to laugh at how many times John got hit by a car and fell out of a window then got up and walked away 😂
The man is invincible lol",5
I mean....Keanu and Laurence toghether in a movie...YOU JUST CANT MISS that !...simply THE BEST !,5
"This movie came out the day before the birth of my first child, I remember telling all my friends that this movie marks the end of my childhood and my adulthood waited for me on the other end. What a farewell, the MCU was such a great part of growing up. I miss how great these movies were, but in a couple of years I'll have a collection of movies to share with my little girl. Can't wait.",5
Thanks for sharing your view with me peace and love ✌️❤️🤟,5
This song in the trailer I was hoping it would’ve been included in the movie. Especially after the ending. This movie can’t be topped either way. The best since the 1st movie imo if not the best. RIP Lance Reddick.,5
“Seasons in the sun” song sums up it up perfectly. Awesome what should be the ending of the series. Spin offs of the new characters would be cool though.,5
I still have faith in Marvel. I think the upcoming projects will be great!,5
got sticked to to the movie from start  till end🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊end part best part 〽️〽️〽️〽️ beautiful songs 😉😉😉😉,5
i watched the first Bhool Bhulaiyaa it was my favourite movie and very funny hopefully this one is awesome too but even if it is the first Bhool Bhulaiyaa will stay my all time fav,5
One of the GREATEST action movies in decades. There's on e scene late in the movie that has to be one of the greatest action scenes of ALL TIME. Must see for any person.,5
Best horror comedy film of all times I have seen this film in theatres Greatest Of All Time,5
I just watched john wick 4 and the movie amazing and great and the ending was emotional and I cried this was very great ❤️❤️😭😭😭😭,5
The reference from the warriors was awesome thanks John wick 4 LOVE IT instead of Coney island it's a church,5
The movie is awesome except the armour suit makes it very funny very unnatural. They don't have any bullet mark on suit even if they get shot😂 better wear a normal armour vest next time 😅,5
Peace and love ❤️✌️😊,5
"Horror to Nahi lagi utni but ya interesting twist Hai 
I love that twist and Tabu Ki acting wah wah wah",5
"I remember being hyped for the 9/11 movie a year ago but didn’t watch until last month, the long wait was definitely worth it. I remember watching United 93 immediately after 9/11 (2017) and I’ve never been so shaken in my life by the best 9/11 movies made. I’ll never forget the tragic hype during United 93 when everyone tries to take the plane back, I knew the victims would do that eventually and my emotional screams were real",5
Bro trust me it's a good movie yea akshay was amazing at the par one bt these both movies ara amazing in there own way kartik also have done a great job and tabbu too the story is different and scary,5
The last greatest marvel movie. I still remember how wild the crowds were in 2019 for this movie. Such a wonderful conclusion to an era of (mostly) immaculate movies.,5
"Akshay sir rahte to aur Maza aata unk tarh comedy aur comic timing kissi ki ni
Best hero for comedy roals",5
It was an amazing movie. Kartik's performance was fabulous. I'm waiting for Bhool Bhulaiya3 with Kartik and Kiara.,5
Some movies don’t need a sequel. I absolutely love kartik but honestly a movie made 15 years ago that already saw great heights and akshay was a natural in it,5
"Donie Yen did an excellent job here, also the Mexican guy from Boyka movie did great job, would like to see him in more movies",5
Wow unbelievable this masterpiece took 15 years to for to bring back 2nd part ❤,5
" @rayyankhan2598  don’t expect that much from Pathaan but he will try his best to save bhai’s career

"Another brave dog in this movie. 
John really have so much love for dogs ❤",5
best John Wick movie ever made ! ...good to see franchise actually getting better unlike Fast n Furious LOL,5
"Crimes committed by 

DCEU: Discard Henry Cavill as Superman and end the Justice League franchise

bhool bhulaiya one was horror and a bit of comedy and this one is focused on comedy and love story so yeahh still good,5
❤️Thanks for the endless love and support you have constantly shown me  in such difficult moment. I’m forever grateful. I really appreciate your unconditional love to me and every effort exerted by you to cause a change…Where are you watching from?,5

"Thanks for you care, love and support towards my career...... Where are you from",5
This feels like this came out a decade ago. I have never been exited for a marvel movie after this. This was the true end of marvel.,5
Thank for your love care and support it’s my pleasure talking to you here where are you from?,5
"re watched the og a few days before checking out 4 still loved it even noticed a few new details
watched 4 on a shit theatre the action scenes were too dark for me
but then i was on a jw high so i rewatched 2 and 3 on the day after
loved 2 maybe even more than the og? noticed amazing details the world building worked so great
3 has amazing action and the whole story finally made sense ! 
so cant wait to re watch 4 (at home)",5
"This and the Dark Knight trailer may be the two best examples of how an unbelievably good trailer gets you pumped up and then the movie blows you away, while goes miles over all expectations.",5
"I'm so happy I actually got to watch it on Opening day and got to experience the hype. Truly the best movie going experience, and I'm not sure we can reach that level of excitement and build up ever again",5
Great movie. Really dumb. But great movie. I would recommend it.,5
"You have to be living in some parallel world, Salman Khan's stardom stops at India's borders. SRK's stretches around the world. Anyways proceeded with creating your fantastical happiness",5
"4 years later..

Still one of the greatest movies to watch and enjoy",5
"I watched this opening night and my god...
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
this is genuinely my favorite action movie of all time (story, characters, arcs, ending, suspence, AND THE ACTION WERE ALL AMAZING 10/10)",5
I watched this  movie super movie I love  this movie,5
Only VFX like Hollywood... and love triangle 🔺️... it is just visual effects here like avengers and marvels ... and it is so boring 😴.,5
Awesome movie I loved it 🤩🤩,5
I will never forget when this trailer first released I was in school. My seventh grade Social Studies teacher who was a huge Marvel fan told me the trailer released. He wrote me and my friends a late pass to our next class so we can all watch the trailer,5
"I love the fact that they've added so many references to Captain America 2, like “On your left” at the end with all the portals, Peggy's phrase (0:40), or the fact that Steve and Peggy finally have the dance they promised each other.",5
Instead of critizing Kartik aaryan....just go n watch this film once you are definitely gonna love it❤️and Tabu's performance is just fab,5
"Acting was good special kartik and rajpal yadav, but story is not good... Horror And Comedy mixed... Why akshay rejected that movie because of script... Thank you.... Waiting next sequence....",5
I watched this movie today only and tbh it's a very good movie it's true that ashay Kumar's bhool bhulayiya was a lot different and good movie but this one was also good and kartik's acting was also top notch. In this era when all movies are the same hero and heroine love story with lots of action scenes if you are searching for a comedy where you can laugh your heart out then believe me bhool bhulayiya 2 is the right option.,5
Thanks to producer only tabu can stand straight or tall in front of vidyas acting she is best .other wise no actress can reach upto the level of vidyas acting,5
"Taking my old man to see this tomorrow he’s 78 and most likely not to enjoy it 😂 but nice for him to humour me on my birthday 🥳 
I’ve got my pencil ready ✏",5
The movie was awesome... If you don't judge with the original one! The twist in the last moment was amazing ! <3,5
You making me giggle thanks for being a fan peace and love ❤️✌️🤟,5
"I have just seen John Wick Chapter 4 and I really loved it. I think this is the best in the franchise.  And as much as I would love to see future installments in the franchise , I have to admit this is a great end to the story. Especially cause the fight scenes are starting to feel a little bit repetitive.  I wasn't bothered but I want the series to finish on a high note.

HOWEVER,  I have an idea for chapter 5.

The movie starts with Shimazu Akira, the daughter of his friend. She's in big trouble and many people are after her. She john wicks her way through the first half of the movie, but she needs help. And she believes that john wick faked his death. She spends a portion of the movie looking for him. She finds him and manages to convince him to help him. The end is an epic half hour j0hn wick vs the table and ends with john killing the table members with help of course but he dies protecting shimazu. It will be nice having john fight for something other than vengeance and freedom",5
What do you love BTS do comment yes or no if you love BTS then take emojis purple colour,5
"This was probably the best movie of all time. The MCU was on top of the world. So what was left for them after this? A sharp D E C L I N E. Marvel has failed terribly with Phase 4, and Phase 5 is going down the same page. The people over at Marvel need to get their act together and start making movies that people actually are interested in and want to watch. Absolute garbage like She-Hulk for example, threw me far away from the MCU, and you're going to have to work really hard to try and draw your audience back in.",5
Peace and love ❤️✌️🤟,5

By watching in yesterday i surely say this sequel is amazing like as title classic humour. Is literally bck ...loved it kudos to the team🔪🔥,5
 @LJSkywalker I like most of the recent stuff. But part of me does agree that the MCU should’ve ended after this film. It was the perfect finale to the franchise that wrapped up everything perfectly,5
I can safe to say this movie was phenomenal Robert Pattinson is amazing as Bruce Wayne/Batman he bring that darker side and the song something in the way by Nirvana fits this theme of the movie! I also really love the Detective side of this film,5
I could never imagine another compelling batman after Christopher Nolans 2007 Dark knight but not only this is a great attempt but was able to beat the Dark Knight in every craft. One of the best Hollywood trailers of all time.,5
"This is the best action movie in decades and the best in the series with a likable lead actor, a great villain, a supporting cast that all brought their A game, a good popcorn plot, AMAZING music, awesome special effects and stunts (stuntmen deserve an Oscar). It didn’t even feel like 3 hours, it flew by super fast. Rina Sawayama real stood out, hope to see that stunning beauty in more movies.",5
I’m a marvel guy but I’m glad dc fans finally get justice,5
"Really forgetable, but the TV Show The Penguin is really a great surprise imho",5
I just loved this movie …. It was awesome wrk by them with ranbir who never did any bad act whenevr a gd script given to him. Mouni looks very promising in negative ❤️😊 please do appreciate the good work rather than behaving like fools. Waiting for 2nd part for sure😍,5
"I love Ben Affleck's Batman and Robert Pattinson's Batman. 

But THIS is a perfect Batman movie. This is SPOT ON what I've always imagined Batman being.",5
Seasons in the Sun by Terry Jacks hits even harder after watching the movie. What a perfect choice for a trailer song after so many perfect JW movies. John Wick 4 was a so damn good.,5
"Watched Chapter 4 yesterday. I went in with very high hopes. But the movie didn't live up to that.

The action scenes are nice, afterall it's John Wick. But I didn't find the plot surprising or exciting enough.

Maybe my expectations were too high. Idk",5
"A detail that I loved in this movie was that Batman actually gets hit with bullets, like A LOT, and showcases how strong his suit is",5
Never watched any of the John wick movies but I do know and love some of what I heard I watched this with my mom the other day and gotta say this has probably been the best movie I’ve seen since no way home might even been better than it,5
"The sound track was good, I remember watching this in the cinema's 2 years ago. It was pretty good.",5
"Thank you so much ❤️.

"Thanks for your love, care and support may God continue to bless you,  where are you chatting from?",5
"The Nolan movies played a massive part in bringing Batman as a character back into the live action mainstream. The way I see this movie is being a grounded interpretation of what Bruce would have been like in his early days. People respect and loge Batman because of how humans he is, yet in films they expect him to be superhuman. Batman’s ‘superpower’ has always been his wealth as a baseline, but also his relentless determination and ingenuity. In a more grounded fictional world, you can’t expect him to become a legend overnight. To me this feels like a refreshing portrayal of what Batman and his first steps into greatness would realistically look like, especially in a live action portrayal.",5
the movie will be going back to the theaters for limited time but I really got no desire to see it again it's just okay batman film to me🥱 just hope matt reeves step his game up in the sequel hopefully with more ACTION!! scenes 🦇🦇💯,5
"The movie leaves you speechless. The photography is stunning. The overall fight choreography is outstanding but the ones with Scott and Keanu, and Donnie and Keanu, are breath taking. What a beautiful end of John Wick. Thank you to everyone that was part of these 4 amazing movies.",5
just watched it and the ending is the most beautiful ending in the history of beautiful endings,5
"Watched this master piece alr in 2022 but I am still here watch the trailer again bc it's awesome

"As awesome as this trailer is, I’m so glad I only watched the sneak peek and nothing else before the movie.",5
"Wow, so much to say/think about this edition of the Dark Knight. I remember days of classic cartoons featuring Batman, like ""Challenge of the Superfriends"" and the Adam West Burt Ward TV show with the great color-costumes of live-action pow, and then came Tim Burton and the Animated Series (on Fox), which were watershed! Christopher Nolan and Ben Affleck gave it nice spice no doubt too. This one featuring the Riddler is both eerie, jarring, graphic, dark, pensive, Realism and neo-modern with classic touches here and there. Jeffrey Wright is good in this too, good supporting character IMO. Batman's surpassed Captain America, no? Batman is officially the strangest super-hero out there. I compare this worlds-graphics trend in Batman-media to the turn we saw with classic (Laurel and Hardy) to modern (Farrelly Bros.) comedy imagery...all humanist. Quite cool.",5
"I watched John Wick 4.
it was a good action movie, I feel like I paid not enough for how good the movie was.",5
"Thanks for your love, care and support may God continue to bless you,  where are you chatting from?",5
"Dark, majestic, deep, that feel of masterpiece, this is the perfect example of how a Batman trailer should make you feel 
In the other hand, bright, emotion, hope, that feel of wonder, that's how a Superman trailer should make you feel
And that I see in both trailers, that's how DC should be, not only dark, not only bright, every character has their aura, it just need to be respected",5
Please make Joker 3. I want to see Joker and Batman meet. It means Arthur and Bruce face each other again. Wonderful,5
Absolutely deliciouly dark and dramatic. The graphics were amazing. Really well casted! Loved it!,5
"I've only just seen the film for the first time on TV. Sometimes it's actually good to get a punch in the face for your bias. Pattinson as Batman...are you serious? OMG, he's good. Finally a dark, gloomy Batman. I was completely engrossed and captivated from the start. A masterpiece!",5
Joker okay over you won it seems okay I also became like a joker...infinitely power end this joker ...all joker any types every all ends all 95ipc ends,5
"The Dark Knight has finally gotten his star! ✨ Batman is the first superhero to be honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame!  A more than deserved recognition for the hero who has inspired generations and continues to do so. And you, which Batman adventure has marked you the most? #Batman #WalkOfFame #Hollywood #DCComics #DarkKnight #GothamCity #Superheroes",5
This is so pleasing. The best,5
"Atlee sir every second is mind blowing, Kindly make next also with srk n Vijay 
U r screenplay and sharp editing is wonderful 
Masterpiece 🔥🔥🔥🔥",5
"Hands down, for me, is the best BATMAN movie ever made, Robert Pattinson is the best live-action Batman, and the entire cast is good as well.",5
"People think this movie is good because of mcu, but when we compare it to actual good movies like se7en and dark knight (which this movie is trying to be) this is pretty boring and average movie",5
Happy 5th Anniversary to Avengers Endgame! One of the greatest of the movies of all time!,5
"Im very critical regarding psychological thrillers, Split was the first movie i would experience as exceptionally good.
Joker being the next one, it's been 2 years since i've seen it and its about time i get to experience it again.

Exceptionally good movies are worth waiting years on end to go for a second or third run, it removes key parts of the excellent movies where i get to re-experience it again.

Joker is soon on my watch list again, after 2 years of refusing to watch again.

LETS GOOO!!! rewatch a masterpiece!!!",5
"With the end of The Penguin it made me relive moments when I was eager to see the jewel of DC, of ​​2022 and of the superhero genre . 

I am super looking forward to part 2 ❤😱❤",5
Movie was amazing and the Penguin was amazing now I just have to wait for the 2nd movie,5
This is the best john wick movie ever made !  This one was deep and definitely Iconic !,5
So ready for the joker crossover. Really love this gritty cinematic universe they’ve created,5
I agree the world building is interesting and is a great set up for spinoffs,5
haters gone hate but this best series ever brings tears to my eyes Brian so proud!,5
watched again batman and it best batman movie best Robert Pattinson just nailed it 🔥 and villan also best in the movie suspense thriller also best 👍,5
" @Rumblingbelly  compare it to older movies like con air, the rock or terminator
Those movies have lots of action and a simple story but still kinda cool
They got somethin that keeps you watching it and sweat every scene and have a good time… this movie has nothing than senseless tiring and boring action scences… and im
Telling this as a guy who like keanu reves, the first matrix movie and even the first john wick… for some reason everyting turns to s***",5
"On this day, five years ago, my childhood of mcu films came to a pause, and i began a new phase in my life, just when marvel ended its greatest phase. God bless the souls that brought us these fantastic theatrical releases, the hype will never be the same again. 🧡",5
"Thank you so much ❤️. Your support is what keeps me going , so in return i have decided to give something back to my fans, Kindly go to my channel description, you will find a gmail address feel free to send in your mail. Thank you",5
"I take it back, Robert Pattinson  is hardcore at portraying this character. He did not drop the batton and Zoe compliments him well. Loved it!❤",5
"I love the part where Nagato asks Dom if he wants to join Akatsuki, and Dom says: ""I'll only go if my family is with me.""
Simply a masterpiece",5
"I just watched this movie Saturday...... 
IT WAS AMAZING! Everything was flawless!",5
"I love the part where Omni-man says ""What will you have after 500 years?"" And dom says ""Family"" That scene was beautiful",5
Robert Pattinson is 2nd best after bale ❤❤. He did justice to this role .,5
Last of the greatest Marvel movies of all time! There hasn’t been anything good after this movie dropped.,5
"Who is here after toxic birthday peek?
Toxic will be good but KGF is a masterpiece.",5
This was so good and such a good trailer,5
"what no lol, what makes this great is the insanely choreographed scenes, amazing cinematography and just overall direction. Nobody is watching John Wick for his character development.",5
"Hoping to get a spin-off movie for Tracker to expand into the Payday gang (more hitman in sleek suits) >.>

If anyone of you are following the ""Payday"" game lore, which interestingly John Wick is a acquaintance to the Payday Gang, Wick and a particular character Nicolas, alias ""Chains"", were former comrades during their time in the military. Which would explain why Mr Nobody would know of John's antics and tactics in greater detail than any other regular tracker would to demand such a high compensation for his service. And also, the video showed how Mr Nobody, similar to John, wore his watch facing inwards suggesting military background. So why would John possibly not recognize Mr Nobody? Possibly because they were just former comrades and not exactly friends, and according to the Payday lore Nicolas a.k.a ""Chains"" due to  his itchy trigger finger and generally unreliable personality caused him to get kicked out fairly fast. Chains had then left the Navy and went into the world of mercenary troops, offering his military expertise to the highest bidder << which was basically what he was doing in the movie. It is possible ""The Tracker"" could have a spin off film to expand on this since in the Payday lore Wick eventually resurfaces after a time of ""going dark"" to lend Chains (and his buddies) a hand. And this could be really exciting if they slowly bring in more hitman in suits i.e. the Payday gang comprising of ""Dallas"", ""Hoxton"", ""Wolf"" and ""Chains"" himself with a lot of depth in their backstory. And to support this, if you look back at John Wick 2 or search ""John Wick Payday easter egg"" on google, you will see an snippet off the film with 2 clown masks behind the extra; and the more prominent clown mask you see?.. is Chains.",5
"As I watched the film already, Brahmastra Film was awesome.
Stunning visuals and great imagination of new mythological world.
there is a power packed start in the beginning of the film by famous actor. 
Won't give much spoilers to you all.
Go and see the film 🎬 in theaters 🍿, have some cinema fun",5
This just came up on my feed and I just had to rewatch it it’s amazing to see how the community of Marvel is still so alive and revisiting this masterpiece right now I’m kinda afraid for Marvel a lot of there films and projects have been REALLY LACKING lately and I hope it doesn’t completely go down the drain I hope we can keep it go back to this level of epicness we got in the film and the others before it…..,5
This this The Best Batman film for meeee and I'm a Bale fan!!!,5
No Movie is a Masterpiece wat are u on marvel boy and this is wayy better den planet apes 💀👊👊,5
 @TheOneAndOnlyHope  noooo way crackhead goofball u better stick to MARVEL This is MY Batman it's the best a real Batman movie 👊👊👊👊👊👊,5
It's been with a heartfelt gratitude I wanna say thank you for your kind words.,5
"This film exceeded even the highest expectations that will never be forgotten. Try to do better, I know, you can't, because this is a MASTERPIECE, now and forever. Marvel for life👊",5
"They went too Marvel with justice league, Batman stand-alone would have been better.",5
"First I wanna apologize to Robert Pattinson, as soon as I came to know he is going to cast as a new Batman, I was upset, coz is not my kind of hero, But le me tell you, when I saw the teaser I was blown away, and when i saw the movie I was numb, please bring him again, That's the movie i like, I was a great fan of marvel but Seriously now I feel I'm grown up man after watching his movie.",5
"John is not dead yet, this is all John's plan to escape from the high table, because what is the trust of the table, call John back for a mission, so John has faked death, the man did not die after falling down from such a tall building. he will die like this and john told to go home we will know all this in john wick chapter 5",5

"I saw it 3 times in a single week. First time i wasn't ready, second time loved it, third I am amazed!!!! It's unique and refreshing and Robert Pattinson was Soo good in it. And i haven't seen any batman films as good as the Dark knight until this came out. Do watch this film!!",5
"The Batman was an incredible movie, loved the amazing cinematography, story, Michael Giacchino’s soundtrack was perfect, the opening scene leading to the Batman reveal was absolute perfection. Robert Pattinson and Paul Dano stole the show as Batman and Riddler, excited for the sequel. 🦇",5
Lol. All these praises are PR bot comments and have like 2-3 comments on their entire Youtube account. Saw it last night. The VFX and huge starcast does not make up for the flopshow storyline.,5
Man i love this movie as much as i love this trailer. Even in 2024 this has got to be one of the best trailers i have ever seen. Especially the last part where the batman theme jumps in is amazing!,5
"SEE THIS FILM IN THE BEST POSSIBLE QUALITY.
John Wick 4 in dolby reignited my love of theatre.",5
This movie won dada saheb award,5
It's all glorified killing... but I loved it 😂 just for movies,5
"John Wick is the most accomplished fictional character of the 21st century. Whoever created it has a genius mind worthy of comparison with the minds of the greatest writers of all time.
And of course, putting Reeves in it makes this character fully realized.",5
I personally thought this was the best Batman adaptation. Robert Pattinson being a recluse and a more traumatic version of Batman was perfection for me. Batman is known to be a great detective in the comics and this movie highlights that. Plus the Batmobile was simple and incredible in action.,5
"If Warner Bros. is serious about reviving the DCEU, please skip the round table convos. It's very simple. Give us epic! Green Lantern: Blackest Night & Brightest Day. Give us the Batman Who Laughs. Just give us epic with a side of darkness. Please get at least 2 serious longtime fans of the comics to serve as consultants. I'm sure you could find a couple with more than a million followers on Youtube. The last time that the DCEU was good was the Dark Knight Trilogy... Man of Steel & the Joker movie were nice too!",5
"This movie has the best meaning of the word. A wonderful movie story, and I have no comment on this movie, but it is the best so far, and this is the first time that I praise a movie 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰😃😃😃😃😃💗💗💗💗💗💗💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💓💞💞💞💞💞💞❤❤❤💘💘💘💘💘",5
"All the details I see on 4K with every scene I watch soooo much perfect! the cinematography so chill, beautiful and some scene look aesthetic 🙌",5

"WHAT a movie 🙆🏻‍♂️


Urge people who are not even fans of the previous three movies to go see it in a decent cinema while it’s still showing. 

What an amazing 3 hours of action that felt more like 90 minutes. 

By FAR the best of the far in my opinion",5
Greatest Batman movie ever! I never expected Robert Patinson can be so good with this kind of genre,5
❤️Thanks for the endless love and support you have constantly shown me  in such difficult moment. I’m forever grateful. I really appreciate your unconditional love to me and every effort exerted by you to cause a change…Where are you watching from?,5
" Keanu Reeves  since Bill and Ted my brother!! You played a goofy character back then but I love the stoic character you play as John Wick.
I’m stoked that you replied at all. I stared at the message in awe and happiness!!!
But if this is not the real Keanu Reeves then fuck you!!",5
"The best part of Keanu that I admire most, is no matter what he's asked about in an interview is that he tries to answer the question he's asked. Sincerely and with honesty. His job is being an actor, which is artistic in it's nature. Celebrity brings pressure along with the glitz that folks seem to see the most of, because we all like fairy tales. Keanu has used his name and good fortune to better the world, no matter what. His life has not been easy or was handed to him, by any means. Like the song written by Israel Houghton, ""One""...... he's a good soul and is using his abilities on earth the best way anyone could. We all want to be happy, but, life doesn't owe us anything. Thank you, Keanu, for putting us in a better place and for making it known, we can learn to fly again after our wings were broken. Everyone loves a ""winner"", but they don't walk in your shoes everyday. Your heart beats like ours does, but, you walk your talk. You n I are not related, but you're my ""brother"". People need to learn, practice and then, DO. What a great teacher you are.",5
Y aquí fue donde lamentablemente murió Marvel también. 😢😢😢. Marvel por favor regresa con todas tus películas épicas,5
 @tanvirpial  still karthik is much better and lovable than star kids he is also much talented than them...,5
Batman seems to be the one franchise that Hollywood hasn't destroyed in recent years. Always fascinating to see where they take the new films. Love how the costume (and car) changes and evolves with each new installment. This looks amazing!,5
"Beef has done the work. Super hit. So, if u wanna success,  then eat beef like Ranbeer, our bro.",5
"OMG JW4 is spectacular!!!! Just saw it tonight (Sat 4/8) and I was transfixed by how incredible this is. 
Go See it peoples 🙌🏻🙌🏻 it is amazing!! 
 I love you Keanu 💟💟💟",5
Perhaps the best conclusion to a movie franchise ever. Everything is better than the previous films and the ending is perfect.,5
This movie and franchise is like an art and someone turn that into a movie. So beautiful and we'll execute. A movie about retired assassin being hunted. WOW,5
"Days before this trailer dropped, me and my friends at college were talking about the rumors online about what the title for this sequel was going to be. Like Avengers Annihilation. And then, one morning when I arrived for class, my friends were all huddled around each other looking at one of their computers. This was before our professor arrived. One of my friends ran over to me saying how this trailer dropped. I got in close to look as we all watched it together. It was a great way to start the morning.",5
Thank you the continuous love and support,5
"Knowing what we know now I love how the trailer didn't give away the plot of the movie. The reveal of '5.....YEARS.....LATER' caught the audience by surprise. This was the peak of Marvel, the end of an era.",5
One of the best batman movies definitely in the top 3 with dark knight and dark knight rises!,5
​ KeanuReeves-faninbox. Thank you so much for your lovely support i really appreciate you for ❤️❤️ please where are you writing from 🌹🌹,5

 Keanu Reeves  just wanted to say that we're really appreciate of your hard work with training to keep a fan like us entertainment and all and I'm just a fan like a young female fan of your not fit in your categories as a old lady friend okay and thank you ❤️,5
Watched the movie today and it's a great final movie.....3 hour action masterpiece,5
How many people here after watching masterpieces ❤❤ Robert is perfect for batman role 👌👌👌,5
"I really doubt we will ever have a moment like this again. I want Secret Wars to be good but with how Marvel is doing, its really hard to stay positive about the Multiverse Saga.",5
"Perfect, this is my best actor, anogona muchinda uyu🔥🔥, sando dzake 🤛🤛🤛🤛",5
Best Batman and best Batman movie.,5
Robert Douglas Thomas Pattinson did an amazing portrayal of The Dark Knight. Great film. Much better than I expected it to be.,5
"Great great batman movie, i am wonder can they somehow related this batman with Joakin's joker for a fcking masterpiece sequel movie?",5
"Great film, and a fantastic trailer",5
"This movie was great, I don’t care what people say. Robert Pattinson delivered a great performance as well as the rest of the cast. I cannot wait to see what they do with the sequel. I hope we get to see Joker 🃏",5
"I love the opening to this trailer, the introduction to Lionsgate with the piano, John Wick walking within the magnificent halls of an Orthodox Cathedral, him lighting a candle to his wife within God's Communion, and him and Donnie Yen speaking as friends next to one another. Great film, and a great (possible) finale to Wicks story.",5
"One of the things I love about this film is that they didn’t try to make it better than Dark Knight or feel like a remake of that film. Instead they took a new approach to Batman by bringing back his origins as a detective/street fighter, and it really helped this movie shine. The Riddler is easily the Heath Ledger Joker of this film, and is improved upon so much better than the original Jim Carrey version!",5
This was a a Masterpiece successful movie liked by my many go watch kids stuffs boy 👊👊👊,5
"""John Wick 5, the Final Chapter"" anyone? Winston and Bowery King were entirely too unmoved at the end, though it's true they're not known for wearing their emotions on their sleeves. And Bubba being there didn't mean anything. In fact, if Wick was really there, in the ground, perhaps the dog would've pawed the grave? But what a way to fade away and find peace? Wick's death is terribly convenient, allowing him to go off somewhere, with a new identity, to live off the grid, find his peace, blah-blah. (Of course that's only the plot of every third movie like this, especially Westerns.)
Side bar: LOVED the set piece shot from above, going room-to-room. The blaster gun, igniting the baddies, was sick! But I was waiting for him to blast one guy and then we see the force of the shot send the flaming bad guy rolling into a large fireplace where he's basically a large burning log! LOL!!! I think it would've brought the house down in the packed theatre where I saw the film. They were already howling and cheering other places. 
Favorite line of the movie: ""Have fun out there.""
Honorable mention: ""Fuck off!""",5
"Beef has done the work. Super hit. So, if u wanna be success,  then eat beef like Ranbeer, our bro.",5

someone please like my comment  . so that i can watch this amazing trailer everytime someone likes,5
"The Batman, skillfully directed by Matt Reeves, offers a captivating cinematic experience. I appreciate the darker approach Reeves took with Robert Pattinson's portrayal. Drawing inspiration from Tim Burton's iconic Batman films of 1989 and 1992, which established a gothic and brooding atmosphere with Michael Keaton in the lead, Reeves masterfully sets a similar tone. The ensemble cast and crew deliver stellar performances, with Zoe Kravitz shining in her role, Colin Farrell transforming into a mesmerizing Penguin - his portrayal so convincing, one could hardly recognize him - and Jeffrey Wright delivering a compelling performance as James Gordon. It would be intriguing to witness Joaquin Phoenix embody the Joker in a potential sequel, pitting his talents against Pattinson's Batman.",5
I can't wait. I'm so excited to watch it. John Wick movie will be the best.,5
this movie was too good kartik nailed it perfectly lots of love ❤,5
Hey movie lovers I can do this on different level....and I do watch lots of movies so I know what audiences want coz all blockbusters movie I do enjoy so point is my movies are gonna be amazing in most genres of movies fiction and non fiction etc etc and etc etc,5

Just watched it Imma try and put into words what I just saw HOLLY SHITTTTT.  Explain to me  how the FOURTH instalment in a franchise is the BEST ONE. That simply DOES NOT happen. This was insanely good. Not a scene wasted. And btw I just farted,5
How knew that after this masterpiece we’d get She-Hulk twerking and trash movies in MARVEL,5

"The John Wick universe is so unbelievably ripe with unique and interesting characters, plots, relationships, etc to the point where they could go anywhere they want with it. The Ballerina is a good start and a good example. They dont even necessarily need John Wick/Keanu in the movie for it to be interesting. The world that they crafted can carry its own weight at this point. So much so that they could really just pick any of the characters that they've introduced (or havent) out of all the John Wick movies and make something out of them. Theres been so many points when watching these movies where someone says something or someone is introduced and I'd say to myself: ""I'd watch a movie about that"". I really hope they take advantage of what they've created.",5
 @vizares  Your such a beautiful man with a good heart I would love to keep in touch with you privately if you want?,5
"I loved the John Wick series, but this one is mt favorite.  The best of the series.  Best fight scenes, actors and story.  Plus I loved when Winston says Just have fun out there.  Also the scenes are memorable.  Especially when John kills the fat man, and John rises.",5

Also i didn't liked kartik aryan that much, so i wasn't going to watch it... But today i watched it 😬😁and wow what a film.. So entertaining from first to last.. Kartik just stole my heart, can you believe that!!! He was soo good and rocked his role.. So did Tabu.. She were amazing... Both movies are different and both were good.. I really loved this movie 👌❤️",5

"Too many redbox viewers insinuated this was lamest attempt at beliveing any of it. so I merely go In Expecting a ""B: Movie  & If It isn Then I Expected It;  If It isnt Then I Like It Enough To rewatch It a Few Times in the future.  Still Better Than reruns on main TV ................ &  Yes, ...  Many Picky whiney Types That will Bash it But Thats Just Self-Explanatory  to as Why They are! Thank You Posters here That Recommend It rationally bcz After All Its Entertainment & That Word is merely personally defined = See previous sentence above.  Yes Keanu Puts His ""ALL""  Into Acting/Characters!!!",5
"Cant believe Scott Adkins looks. In my opinion, he shouldnt be fat in the movie. His body should just stay the way it is it couldve been more thrilling to see Adkins fight. Loved his stunts and actions. But still tho, great movie as always. I just wish adkins is not fat. Thats all 😁😁😁",5
Happy Birthday Keanu Reeves! One of my favorite action stars to watch!,5
"This is truly an amazing movie, i would urge everyone that sees this movie to watch ""The Warriors"" from 1979 before you watch JW4. It truly made JW4 even better. What a brilliant series this is!",5
Still the best action movie I’ve ever seen. I LOVED IT,5
"@lionsgate, I know you guys get thousands of comments and millions of emails but this is the greatest adventure I've ever seen in my life. the aerial camera scene at the end is the greatest thing I have ever seen in any movie. Every single movie in this series keeps getting better and improving upon the previous one, I have no idea how you guys are doing it but thank you so much for your work. I am in love with the 4th one. You outdid yourselves. Everything is so stellar I'm just at a loss of words and almost cried at points out of sheer amazement of your work. The first one was my favorite, then the second one, then the third one, and now this one. I don't even know how you keep on improving and finding unique takes on the series. I love your work. I also immensely love the blind guy starting in on the action at the beginning. It was so slick. This movie felt like something more than a movie and I've never said that in my life. I kept on watching the third one over and over while waiting for this one. I actually waited to watch this one because I was savoring the moment as odd as that sounds. Every single moment of acting was literal perfection as well. I'll be watching this one for quite a while. You guys put me in another world while watching and thank you and thank you for reading my comment.",5

Koki done a great job in this movie
Loved it❤️❤️❤️❤️🤩🤩🤩",5
I saw this on my birth week (movie came out a three days after my birthday) with my dad and his friends ❤ I love rewatching the trailer to get the same vibes 🥰,5
I know it ends well but I do hope they make one more. This series is the best thus far for newer movies.,5
"I loved the first film, the best in the franchise in my opinion. The franchise has run its course, #4 gave us a satisfying farewell to John Wick! Time to move on to the interesting looking prequel tv series 'The Continental'.",5
I liked this movie but my no.1 is the old one I don't know maybe best actors where in it I loved akshay acting it was non stop fun as someone said the old other character where too good. I only liked the best part was the ending that's it.,5
Currently watching it in the 3rd act just was curious how much they actually showed during the trailers lol god I love this movie it’s such an amazingly fun ride,5
"Thanks Marvel for changing things. 

The MCU changed since this movie, mid projects and a bad reputation. 

But now, we actually see changes if we look at the leaks and the delays. Thanks Disney/Marvel for saying ""Quality > Quantity, Quantity > Quality no more"", we need movies like Vol.3, Shang Chi, Eternals and series like WandaVision, Loki, TFATWS. 

Even Echo, who wasnt incredible, showed us that Marvel put efforts now, Echo was like a teaser for a more mature Marvel. 

I have the feeling that 2025 will be the comeback of Marvel, not 2024 because, except Deadpool 3, the projects are ""I dont care tier"".

Please Marvel, give us the MCU we deserve, not the MCU pre-Endgame, because it would suck if the Universe didnt have any evolution, bur give us the MCU 2.0, when Spiderman, Daredevil, Dr Strange, Sam Wilson, Kang, mature Thor and Hulk, a better Captain Marvel are the faces. 

Avengers 5 will be incredible, but you can top Infinity War and Endgame if you improve your previous achievements. 

Marvel, please, be an event again. And I know you're doing a massive change and us, Marvel fans, are proud of this lucidity. 

One more thing, please Kevin, please, do an interview when you say ""Sorry"" to us, sorry for making Quantity over Quality. We can wait another year if that mean that the next projects will be incredible.",5
My happy place is revisiting this masterpiece,5
Marvel just randomly recommended me this after 5 years and now am really wanna use that time machine to go back and rewatch this masterpiece,5
@KeanuReeves-faninbox.  I'm an avid fan of him ever since from speed movie. I love how he act and portray his role ❤️ 😍 and what about you?😊,5
I agree Patrick - The Marquis De Gremand was a cool Baddie - to JW's discreet humble hero - and the scenes all shot in great Parisian light - simply awesome dialogue too - the first JW movie ive seen - loved it now i need to see 1-3 Ffs !!!:face-red-droopy-eyes:,5
Best bhool bhulaiya  best Akshay Kumar,5
I love you Shruti. I love you. I love you Shruti I love you Suji Suji❤,5
"Today I watch this movie ..I liked it but in my opinion the first half was good  but in second half they just messed up the story ..
Kartik was fab throughout the movie 🎬  ❤ !!
Tabu mam did a really good work 👏  !! 
Kiara was also good but I don't know anyone feel this or not but i think being the leading lady she must have Lil more scenes..",5
"Was quite surprised they'd use ""The Warriors (1979)"" radio scene to duplicate and use on JW4  to inform Hunters of JW location and progress.",5
Love this movie a lot!  This is my all time favorite now!!! 😍,5
"U cant compare ... Part one and part two... BB 2 is a complete roller coaster ..... Thrill love suspense and comedy ... Tabu maam💯❤️
Jst loved it.... Kamal... Love frm Pak🇵🇰",5
"Yes. Dp3 did lots and lots of promotions around the globe. And it's under Marvel. So easy billion. I dont think JW4 did international promotions. Though JW is a well know character, it shoulda done more in BO",5
"Super movie great story
Awesome Acting.. 😍😍",5
"I just watched John Wick 4 last night and i was blown away on how good it was . Most franchises get terrible  after the second film , but this one just got better and better. The plots got more intricate , each  baddy was better than the previous one, every new character introduced , whether a small or large part , was superbly done by the actor and the fight scenes just got better and better. Now we all knew that this was to be the last John Wick film , but WOW what a final twist to the John Wick character  . Who would have seen that coming ? I tip my hat to all of those involved in the making , of this amazing film franchise.",5
Amazing movie🔥🔥 .. kartik is so talented .,5
 @masterm537  Your such a beautiful man with a good heart I would love to keep in touch with you privately if you want?,5
"Just watched the film. 👀
Superb ! Loved the story & acting. ❤
All the actors-actresses were amazing.  👏",5
Thanks for your love and support where are you texting from?,5

"I really loved character of caine, he’s one of the best I’ve ever seen yet 🔥♥️",5
"Must of watched john wick 3 a hunndred times all day long. I watched number 4, I kept seeing sunrises like constantly for a few days, now I know its directly tied into this movie. So golden. Iove and adore the nunchucku scene. So beautiful.",5
Its good movie but same story nothing new same the other part the keain he is the best in the movie,5
This movie was actually amazing! Loved it! Original still holds its own but this is a worthy sequel,5
jhon wick is very nice but  jason statham is the best,5
Your so right you should win a medal just for saying that thank you. Everyone thinks this movie is Terrible and the Little thing in it remember action movies don’t have to be realistic to be better just relax and enjoy this wonderful experience then you will fathom,5
"Great story, but if Akshay Kumar played the lead role, it would be very satisfying.",5
"FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE i WATCHED WHOLE MOVIE IN JUST  3 MINUTES 
THANKS to TSERIES 
YOU GUYS ARE DOING VERY GOOD JOB I HOPE WE'LL SEE MORE 3 OR 4 MINUTES MOVIES SOON",5
Watching JW1 to JW4 is intense yet fascinating how the story evolved and the casts are magnificent. This action movie is once in a lifetime roled and molded to be the most outstanding ever.. Great Job to you all👏👏👏,5
"compare the bucket of marvel and JW, JW is printing cash caompare to marvel crappy shjt now",5
You can't really Compare a movie which Has 2 Popular super heroes from the world's biggest multi billion dollar franchise to a small successful franchise...i mean Marvel fandom is considered the 2nd biggest fandom after star Wars fandom in pop culture media and Deadpool 3 was an event movie that's why the fans of Marvel/wolverine/Deadpool and the superhero genre went to theatres...john wick movies did great compared to their budgets,5
I love both. But most people/kids love superheroes tho.,5
"​ @letsgetreal100 Okay good ,I would love to have a private chat with you my dear❤",5
"Thank you so much for all the love and support, I’d wish there’s another way to show gratitude other than me coming down on social status 😊",5
"The fights in this movie are insane. Everybody is wearing super strong bulletproof vests, loved that. Great movie",5
"Today I watched it for the first time in cinema .
What a movie whaaat a fu*kin movie its sooo frekn insane !!!!!!! for me this's a best chapter in the series i love it ❤ 100000000/10 thank you Keanu",5
"I think the movie is going to be good I love this actor he got a soul but this trailer isn't good, the action and the music was not good.",5
"Great Movie, Best Movie Of The 2020’s So Far & The Best John Wick, Yes I Know, “The Stair Scene” & “The Green Screen Sunrise” That Sucked, Everything Else Was Perfect",5
 @elliott6926  nah it's perfect love this trailer.,5
"Was disappointed with Chap.4! Loved the first three! The almost 3 hr run time didn't bother me  BUUUT.....Bill Skarsgard's character wasn't a very convincing villain, Shamier Anderson as the ""tracker"" was really corny, and Weston's over the top tan (LOL) were three things I couldn't get past in this one. Honestly, even though I enjoyed them, there were way too many (and too long) fight sequences in this film that didn't jive well w the bland story line! A 4 hr run time (to balance out all the fight scenes) would've been justified if better dialogue and more convincing main characters (as mentioned above) were present. The tires ran flat to the finish in this franchise!",5
John wicks the hollywood version of a bollywood movie where the hero can never be killed no matter how many opponents are there,5
"WOW! This was absolutely brilliant! The battle scenes were unprecedented. Especially the scene shot from above brought back nostalgic memories of old games that were shot from above. ❤ We want Chapter 5 🙏 Arnold Schwarzenegger would say: ""DO IT. DO IT NOW!"" 😄 Do it, but think about it well, so that it will be as good as all the previous ones. All parts have been absolutely great so far!",5
"Every second in john wick 4 is perfect , but a message for lionsgate : you can't kill a legend that easy , im mad cause this end and he never stand face to face to the organisation that build all of this , i think there is a chapter missing in this masterpiece .",5
"Thank you so much for all the love and support, I’d wish there’s another way to show gratitude other than me coming down on social status 😊",5
"A great fan of KR and was really looking forward to enjoying John Wick 4, but it fell flat. The action scenes in the glass mirrors was a repeat, the falling down the steps (all of them!), the blind man who miraculously could shoot every target perfectly, JW himself bouncing off cars, buildings, and bone crunching assaults to be able to walk around without any problem just became a yawnfest after a while. And the final duel scene was obvious and only surprising that JW hadn’t turned to use his bullet on the 🦨. Lucky there is no #5 …….. unless ……… never say never! Even the daughter’s reappearance was overdue in the script. If it can be called a script. 🙈🙈🙈🙈🙈",5
"This was the audition for highlander, the church at the beginning, the ""who is this ?"", the table, epic swordfights', and closest thing to the Matrix Chad has been given the green light to do, that 100 million budget will grow to 200 million at least. The new Highlander and Immortals will be like tackling 50 man-eating lions, i saw this trailer online and even my fiancé was saying wtf is Highlander. Henry will be 5x more ripped than Superman for sure, and Chad has given some teases but he is not telling, if Chad pulls it off and that is a big ""if"" he goes into the major Director category in my worthless opinion. It is free reign to make human people inhuman. And hopefully, it will be very successful, I think Keanu will feature as an immortal. Most of all Henry C is going to be the most ripped man in cinema history. ""Under the old laws, only one can survive."" - yeh they are paraphrasing that line from Clancy Brown !!!!!!!!!!!AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH",5
this  movie it’s fantastic but bhool bhulaiya1 part Akshay Kumar it’s the best brilliant No.1movie best in the best,5
"The  JW films  so far (1-3) had their appeal...had a good premise....but  at times  bordered on being tantasy when i think the idea was to  make JW  ""realistic""...al the training they put Keanu rhough.

What  I found odd  and mising was  that JW didn't have a ""sniper rifle"" yet he wa an  ""elite level assassin"".  I'm guessing  the  ""sniper rifle"" would be the 41  weapon for an  ""assassin""??  To be good at not being seen....like a  ""ninja""  SHOULD be...""neither seen nor heard""....as much as spossible.  Even int he  Jason Bourne films they did have  JB behind the scoe of a sniper rifle--CHECK. 

Assassins I'd think would also be masters of diguise.....

Only problem i had with JW1---the Russian mob  just walked into JW's ""lair""...unheard. Shuld be layers upon layers of  traps and alarms...and seceral quick escapes for JW....and to  beat him within an inch of his life  in thebeginning???  How was he going to recover  to do the rest of the film??   H should have been  handicapped after that beating if not killed...if not killed forced to do his kills from a distace--snipr rifle...no way he'd be able to  ""hand to hand""..etc. 

Sniper rifles  are i think  ""standar issue"" for assasins :)) The Professional.  THe American (clooney).  Sniper (Tom Berenger).....Odd  Crusie's character didn't have  one in Collateral.",5
I love John best actor for me ❤,5
Keanu has best to be an agent like as James Bond. This is the best live action movie.,5
"All the girls are praising this movie bcz of kartil aryan only
But the real truth is that bhool bhulaiyaa 1 was a masterpiece and they know this thing.",5
"This movie teaches something very nice... ""having a good mentor is important"" Winston is always advising him to play it smart with the right move and making John use his skills to the max 😄❤️👌",5
"I recently watched John Wick films back to back, I absolutely love the 4th one. Its a franchise that just keeps getting better and better and makes you root for the protagonist and his friends",5
"Best action movie 2023 by far well put together, soundtrack is great",5
"Not the best of the series but really good nonetheless, he just takes too many ford fiestas to the face man and just walks it off, really enjoyed it anyway.",5
"Met Keanu today wth his band Dogstar but have yet to watch a full John Wick movie. Have only seen parts of them. After meeting him today though, I will change that starting tonight haha. Super cool in person!",5
"I love this movie but I think they need to end john’s story here. Expand the universe if you want, but all great (anti?)hero’s deserve a great ending. This was his. Bring him back for flashbacks if you must, but not every character’s story needs to stretch on forever.",5
"John Wick 1 & 2 are good. Hated 3. Over the top and just violence for the sake of violence. A revenge series turned into some superhero fantasy shit which just has no realism whatsoever. And I have yet to see 4. But will do. I think it's a franchise that is well overrated in my opinion. The fight scenes are superb but the whole spectacle is just way over the top for my liking. Saying all that, Keanu Reeves is amazing, as usual. Each to their own.",5
"Thank you for your continuous love and support ❤️
How long have you been a fan of mine?",5
"great rant and a great movie! i feel like they made it just for me. it fulfilled everything i can ask for. cinematography was awesome, music was well thought out and locations epic, fun action and cool story with one of my favorite actors and his ol buddy Morpheous haha Def one of my favorite movies ever and that says alot bcuz im not easily pleased.",5
It is so good there are good.,5
"Personally I loved the tribute paid with the radio DJ, that’s stems right from the 1979 movie Warriors. Then you have the box of shotgun shells labeled dragons breathe going back to Keanu’s roll in Constantine when he was given dragons breath as a weapon, and of course you have Clancy brown playing the harbinger who says “in the end only one remains” an homage to his 1986 film highlander where he played the Kurgan. I absolutely loved these little throw backs subtly put in there",5
"I am watching this trailer after 3 hours of bb 2 ,I was a great movie bro,I loved it and the twist was mind blowing I have never seen this type of twist in Bollywood , we should not compare the two movies both are the best in thier own eras",5
"Next level movie in the Hollywood 🥵🔥
This movie has only seen legends💀🪓🔥
Thanks director for giving us this movie🌸✨

Love From Bangladesh 🇧🇩",5
"Watch Mission Impossible 7 over it.
While this movie better than it’s predecessors but I don’t have in me to see 2h47min of guy killin on guys no matter it gets slightly better but I can watch a mission Impossible movie for that long though the new movie wasn’t the best and would be the fourth best Mission Impossible imo but it’s ironic that they’ve set their own standards and the step to AI wasn’t the best or half good it’s two prequels (Syndicate & Lark/Apostles), it’s still the best action franchise going and Ik I could care less but the next movie would most likely change my mind ❤❤",5
"My Favorite movie of the year ♥️
Kartik aaryan's acting was the best 🤙♥️",5
"50M views? Yeah, right! Yes, indeed, Marquis. New York is responsible for a huge number of atrocities. NYC is an atro-city.",5
Thanks for your love and support where are you texting from?,5
"Wow....just wow.  The storyline and action was just amazing.

I love how they have Chinese, Japanese, African American, Middle Eastern and European all in this Super ACTION sequel.

I must say it's One of the Best or the Best ACTION Movie I've seen in a long time.

Donnie Yen was Amazing in this movie so was the rest of the cast.",5
"Lets not compare the old version with this, both are a masterpiece Vijay did a very good job here✨❤️love this movie✨",5
"Watched JW4 twice last week. Its the best action movie i have ever seen. We can watch all those action multiple time without getting bored.. And i like the way they give respect to all actors of this movie.. Especially Donnie Yen.
🔥🔥",5
"The father should not differentiate between his two daughters, Angelica  and mangolica . He must treat them with the same love and care, so Angelica felt jealous, because this is her right and a natural thing, because we feel jealous when the father loves his daughter more than the second.",5
XD. Maybe you're just salty 95% of people love these movies and you're left out.,5
to confusing to much goin on ..this kind of movie is to unrealistic..and to crazy.....not like a good mix movie like the equalizer with denzel... a good mix that keeps your head clear and understand the meaning of it....please gear a bit down ..and make some mind clearing breaks in these movies..,5
Thanks for your love and support where are you texting from?,5
"Bhool bhulaiyaa 1 is much better, interesting, good film than bhool bhulaiyaa 2",5
Watching these trailers in a while after watching the movies is bringing such a nostalgia. It's like meeting an old friend and remembering old days... Masterpiece!,5
What a great movie 🎬.  Just wow.,5
I am here after watching the movie and I didn’t like it. I don’t know why people are going gaga over this. Like the movie was totally illogical; not spooky at all. Kartik and Kiiara was okay. Tabu and few others did fantastic job though.,5
Last night i watched John Wick 4. This movie is a masterpiece and in my opinion the best of all 4 movies. All 4 John Wick movies are fantastic and a real masterpiece. Thank you for 4 masterpieces. 👏👏💪❤ 🎬 🎥 📽 🎞  🔝,5
"I don't think the villain is Manjolika, it is her father. He gave his love and affection to anjali ka more than Manjolika at a very young, this caused Manjolika turn evil. So, in the end it was his father is the main villain.",5
"Actually better then part one ,tough it would be more better if we could say akshey kumar ..but he did really good job..story line comedy story was much better then part 1",5
i love this movie it still gives me the 2024 vibes like  last year i felt so good lisenting to this song a million times,5
"Just watched it and it’s frustrating how the people survive countless bullets at close range, they somehow don’t get hit, I know it’s action but wow atleast it should’ve been believable. Took me 3 days to finish it, wasn’t really interesting FOR ME.!!!!",5
"Man, it's been a year since we saw this modern action masterpiece.. I will not forget how mesmerizing and unforgettable this film is in terms of not just action but filled with a compelling story with each character and John himself, too.. It's absolutely incredible. Happy 1st anniversary, John Wick: Chapter 4, my NEW favorite John Wick movie.",5
"Realll and honestly, this is still one of the best trailers I’ve ever watched like the music is emotional, but doesn’t really good job of capturing the feel of the movie this is still one of the best trailers. I have seen in a while.",5
First Indian trending movie bhool bhulaiya I love bhul bhulaiya so funny,5
Super super super,5
"Keanu Reeves was born to play John Wick. 
Donnie Yen stole the show.
Bill Skarsgard was despicably brilliant.
Not a single character out of place and one of the best action movies and franchises ever",5
All these amazing trailers keep popping up on my YouTube BEST believe I'm watching them again. Brings back the good times.,5
"Thanks for your unconditional love and support, where are you located?........",5
I care a lot about film. This is the best movie ever made. I literally think about how I’m crazy and what I’d compare it to and it’s like Casablanca and a new hope. If you don’t like this then it’s a you thing.,5
 @yamatovergil3408  Your such a beautiful man with a good heart I would love to keep in touch with you privately if you want?,5
"Oh no.. not Chinese Kung fu stuff here... I thought John Wick is all about the realistic fight scenes.  A lot of people love this movie for realism too.  John Wick or any of best of the best assasins got killed by blind Kung fu master.  Idk.. maybe the movie is heavily targeting chimese viewers cuz to them, Kung fu is the best in real fights.",5
This movie was fantastic. It was so good and had so many good action scenes. And that ending 😭,5
"KR worked very hard into the fight scenes, either the doubles filmed, or even more of those, in this part, being appreciated! He is some sort of Dark Comic character, with his unreaded attitude and way of speaking. Either the director is great by putting all thiz together astonishing! Best part so far! 10 + 👊💪🔥🔥🔥👏👏👏",5
"I remember being in highschool when I watched JW3 waiting for JW4. I was so excited it was set to release in 2021, then it was pushed to 2022 and then 2023. When I first saw this trailer I was so happy. Then finally getting to watch it was the best feeling ever",5
I agree. Brian was always the main character of the series and him departing is a good closure to the series. In 7 they were all pardoned and free.,5
 KeanuReeves-faninbox.  I have been a fan for over 25 years and I loved the original Warrior film.,5
"They should of stopped after Chapter 2. This movie really stretches credibility to the impossible. Wick (and most of the other combatants) get shot many many times, to NO effect! I get how their suits are a kevlar weave, but seriously?! To be that effective, they'd have to be wearing Ironman's armour!! And a blind assassin?! Keanu's acting is very wooden. Always has been. But no new dialogue at all ""i need a gun"" :) At nearly 60yrs of age, Keanu is still reasonably competent at the hand-to-hand fighting stunts. But he was noticably less so in this movie.  Please...no more sequels. Count your money guys, and be happy OH! the best character had to be..Scott Adkins!  Wearing a fat suit, and still kicking the shit out of Wick! He looked like he really enjoyed himself.",5
If you don't fight for your love what can love do you have ✌️❤️🤟,5
"Kartik aryan fabulous job in movies osm & tabu brilliant fantastic, realy appreciate kartik, tabu, alll character movie osm amazing this movie is not one time watch , 👌👌👌👌👌👌♥️♥️♥️👌👌👌👌 Entertainment, enjoy kartik dance brilliant",5
Thanks for your continuous love and support van diep❤️❤️,5
"I just watched the trailer for the new James Gunn Superman film. I am back here watching this trailer because I wanted to see what a really exciting trailer should be. A good trailer will excite fans and get us amped up for the upcoming film. I got none of that with the new Superman trailer. Hopefully, it is a great film with a weak trailer.",5
Thanks for your unconditional love and support I really appreciate you where are you located,5
Peace ✌️ and love ❤️,5
Smiles peace and love ❤️✌️,5

"Wow what a movie ! Better than Bhulbhulaiya first part ..kartik aryan rocks ..movie ,story everything good ..paisa wasool.. must watch it",5
is it just me that thinks this movie was dog shit? the first two films are amazing. the third wasn’t as great but good. this one felt like a parody of the series.,5
I seen this 3 times in the theater and loved it and bought it on apple tv good movie and very good scenes,5
Kartik aryan just nailed the role everyone's acting was at point there were  some jumpscares and funny moments that made this movie more perfect .Loved it ❤️,5
"OMG. 
Akshay Kumar was and will be the king when it comes to this movie. All due respect for everyone and newbies but honestly the first one was the best. All actors and their characters were just amazing!",5
It's just an awesome movie... It has it's own... Uniqueness... I enjoyed it very much... And the End was... Just mind blowing 😍😍😍😍,5
it's super movie and I love it,5
The best film for MARVEL,5
1st is best. Comedy create nhi ki hai,5
Everyone is talking about Akshay Kumar I agree that his acting is powerful and his movie's hit era's but we should appreciate the new talent Kartik is very good actor and he try his best .we should support him.,5
" @Isaac._sk  You say that, but the moves during the first movie were very cool to look at because they actually looked achievable, now though you might aswell have mutants and zombies join in because all pretense is thrown out the window. New Director and writers tend to do that though.",5
 @mayankvlogsit8143  its been 5 years and none of the MCU movie got blockbuster and now there is no hype for Marvel movie Disney made Marvel trash,5
always loved the avengers since 2018. always will be a masterpiece of a series,5
​ @jet3272 Thank you so much for your lovely support i really appreciate you for ❤️❤️ please where are you writing from 🌹🌹,5
Thanks for your continuous love and support Josephine ❤️,5
SRK as Pathaan had such a mighty screen presence than Washed out actor Salman in Billi 3 Trailer :3 Aah!! Happy that Pathaan exists in this universe,5
love this movis yarr its best watched it so  many times love it,5
This trailer is GREAT 👍 I haven't seen it yet should I? Don't know 😕 The first one is good.,5
This was my first movie in threater. Loved it. Pure nostalgia and goosebumps from bgm. I just hope BB3 doesn't ruin this franchise.,5
It's such an amazing piece and acting of Kartik Aryan is awesome,5
This must be nice but love with the Akshay Kumar role,5
Everyone is praising Akshay. It's  okay. But how will new actors prove themselves if they don't get a chance. U guys should appreciate kartik Aryan . He's also a good actor.,5
"Please doont compare, appreciate everyones hardwork and effort, you dont know how negative comment can affect some artists!",5
Thanks for your continuous love and support Julie❤️❤️,5
"The REAL end of the MCU, as we knew it. We didn’t feel it back then, but after our favorites, we kinda left too, in our hearts. It is what it is. Marvel had an amazing run…🙏🏾",5
"2022 ---- Kartik nailed in this Movie, Every one can see his talent , his acting ......
Just 1 request to all you guys -- never let him die like Susant Singh, support him",5
😅 Truth anyway thanks for being a fan peace and love ❤️✌️🤟,5
Happy to see one of the OLD MALAYALAM movie had great impact on film industry and remade into 5-6 different Language and now second time here in Bollywood...,5
Thank for your love care and support it’s my pleasure talking to you here where are you from?,5
This trailer wasnt the hype train everyone was hoping and the movie wasnt was everyone was hoping for. But that fuckin title card was AWESOME,5
pls support him he is doing very well better than askhay,5
"Keanu Reeves has always been brilliant and mysterious in his films, which gives additional doses of suspense and integration to his work. A tribute to this brilliant and accomplished actor.",5
Agree when i saw the trailer and read the comments i also thought that movie is not going to be interesting and funny as part 1 but to be honest this part is as good as first part and karthik is a great actor and tabu i love her she carried the whole movie  and kiara also did tremendous job,5
"The World has Changed and None of us can go back 🥺 All we can do is our Best.

And Sometimes the Best we can do is to START OVER.

I was really Hoping to pull off one last one ❤
We Will. Whatever it Takes !!!

(Every Single Word in this Trailer is connecting to our Lives so much) ~MARVEL FOREVER",5
Awesome! Love Keanu,5
Just love this movie best movie ever I see❤,5
"Those who are saying that no one can beat Akshay and Vidya Balan.. let me tell you Vidya and Akshay both did fantastic job but part 2 is very very good same as part 1..and Karthik , kiara and tabbu all of them are really talented even they performed tremendous job and i really liked comedy ,acting, story, and concept,, everything is perfect..we have set our mentalities that no one can beat old actors but there r so many talented actors and everyone have their competitors...all the actors and actresses are best in both movies ..it's good not to compare but better to appreciate their hard work, it takes time to become ""brand"" 🔥",5
"Wow, looking back, they did a REALLY good job not spoiling how they got the stones in different timelines in the past and etc. This is a very good trailer.",5
Vidya Balan performance was best in 1st series but katrina kaif was awarded as best actress tat year stupid,5
"To be honest, I don't think there is any other movie that will be able to offer the quality of action that the John Wick series offers. I waited nearly four years insanely to see the end, and it was really great. In any case, the movie is a visual pleasure. My rating is 9/10.",5
"Kartik Aryan a self made hero ❤️🔥
I just love his acting",5
"I liked the movie but it was too damn long. The action was good but it’s like does every single fight scene have to be 20 minutes long…by the end I was just like thank god it’s over. And why TF would you put Scott adkins in a fat suite, come on that just looked weird.",5
Best movie and best franchise ever I love John wick soo much ❤❤,5
I hope you don't stop watching my movies all my best peace and love ✌️❤️🤟,5
Yes it’s a very good movie u will enjoy,5
Bhai aaj ki Dekh kr Aaya hoon and it was lit superb awesome🔥🔥 All the characters gave their best and 100%🤗🤗,5

"John Wick + Sisu + Jack Reacher = The best movie ever , wow !",5
Hi .. sir good morning how nice 👍🙂 hai kitne baje kotha ta good night,5
Omg 😲 super super movie,5
The movie is good but the real credit of its success goes to Tabbu .The most powerful part was climax and that's all due to Tabbu. Kartik and Kiara were good but real showstopper was Tabbu.,5
Aisy hero ko ly ky movie ka satiyanas kr diya 😒,5
Such a sweet fan I hope you don't stop watching my films I've got a warrior spirit in me I can be your hero ✌️❤️🤟,5
"Donot compare akshay and kartik ,,,,akki is always best but ...In that time kartik give their 100% and I love it ,,,,,he is also a lagend❤️",5
"I’m at the point where I think we will never get anything like this again in our lifetimes. The first Iron Man came out when I was 12 lol. To be invested in characters for that long, and have so many others along with you for the ride is special. To say Infinity War and Endgame were events is an understatement. Endgame was by far the best theater experience I’ve ever had. Full IMAX theater filled with laughs, tears, joy. Glad to have lived through it.",5
"If the producers or any staff read comments, i just wanna thank you guys for one of the best movies ive ever watched. I literally didnt take my eyes off the screen, i was locked in!!! A+++",5
Really amazing and comedian movie... bohuat acchi movie ha ... wave..😁😃😀,5
"Where do I even begin, this movie is an absolute masterpiece. Chapter 4 took this series to levels I did not even think were possible, the last 3 entries in the series were absolutely amazing and were near perfection but chapter 4 is the best by a mile",5
Peace and love ❤️✌️,5
"Haha thought the same thing, but why was YT promoting it on my feed? Lol",5
"I seen this movie.....so nice graphics , editing , story , sespence
And also better cast and acting...
...
Japanese , and female actress so hot.....sexy...

This trailer explains MCU from 2008 to 2019 in 2:26 mins...Still one of the best marvel movie trailer of all time!!🗿🔥 Mavel at Peak🔥,5
Wow this is the best movie ever my favorite cool 😎 😍 👌 ❤️ ♥️ 💜,5
I just want to see John happy and at peace for a few minutes! Can we get 20mins in a beginning of him half ass settled down please? We just want John to be happy a little bit.,5
"It's simply unbelievable how this multi-billion dollar franchise collapsed in four years. I do not understand this. The First Three Phases of the MCU (Infinity Saga) are pure gold. Anyone have any idea what went wrong? It hurts to see what happened to Marvel. Nowadays, they sometimes have nice productions (Loki, No Way Home, Shang-Chi)... but the quality of others has decreased significantly. Can someone tell me...WHY?

We owe all of Marvel's success to Kevin Feige. He's STILL the head of Marvel. He didn't leave. Why isn't it working out for him right now?",5
"Really good movie, tabu, Kartik acted really well, and  the entire cast acted so well, super entertaining !!",5
I watched the film. At first it's just like an ordinary action film and as it progressed things started becoming interesting and last hour was amazing. But in a film of about 3 hours every scene was looking like going at supersonic speed there's action after action. I think it needs some better dialogues and some calmness with action a little soft comedy may be more better 💥 good luck for JW5🔥 but I'm looking forward to Ballerina more...,5
"And here we are, five years later remembering this outstanding moment without knowing what was coming... Thank you Russos, thank you Marvel, thank you Stan Lee.",5
Enjoyed this movie a lot! KARTIK Aryan and tabu were too good. And very nice comedy indeed 👌🏻,5
"""Wish we could turn back time to the good old days"" very true after the current state of marvel",5
Peace and abd love ❤️✌️,5
 @brianfisher4701  ah yes because everything in Infinity Saga was great and loved.,5
"Great movie but John being bulletproof and not even flinching from point blank range was just a bit too much suspension of disbelief. I get his suit is kevlar or something but c'mon. If you can get past that and endure the extended fight scenes, which are great on a big screen with a good sound system but can drag, just a pinch, you'll enjoy it. The first is still my favorite though",5
"Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Ian McShane, Fishburne, Halle Berry are the best actors you could have put in John Wick and easily made it a solid entertaining fun film. Every single chapter was so fun to watch, filled with action and creative kills you just hope don't end! Keanu Reeves, just speechless over his incredible performance everytime which just gets better as the next John Wick releases. The cast was the best picks and had they been other actors it would not be as big and popular as it is, just wow. JW4 blew my high expectations out the window, the movie is the best action movie I have seen since JW3! Brilliant all around and to everyone included in making this masterpiece, this is a movie everybody remembers years ahead and it is so impressive that each chapter has been thoroughly entertaining throughout, there is no bad John Wick movie. This is a must watch!",5
"Another great addition to John's story, except for....  Hey, Big Boppers.... Anyone remember that? Plagiarism or stealing from the best? Walter Hill would like the homage.",5
All actors did a Great job.. Specially I loved Tabu's performance,5
😊 Thanks for being fan peace and love ❤️✌️,5
when marvel brought up time-travel + the most awaited movie = BEST MOVIE,5
"You Know What, John Wick Chapter I, Is Still The Best, Because There is More Emotional and Intensity of Act, not Just Some shit Action more & more.",5
"We need a John Wick series, but in a parallel timeline, where he didn't die.  Or at least faked his death.  This saga is too rich in content and inspirations to end with ""only"" 4 episodes. Please, we fans ask you to think about this.",5
"The trailer seems not to be so interesting, but trust me the movie is . The movie is damn good and all the roles were played well. Full of humour and a bit horror. I think this is the only sequal which is slightly better than the original .Just loved the movie 😃😃😃",5
"Only one question needed answering for me, just how was Wick not dead from the end of 3? Shot to the head, falls off a roof, cracks his head and neck on a dumpster at the bottom...it is simply not possible to recover from that, so they ignore it. Some weak nod to Fishburne is not enough, and that blemishes the movie from the start as there are no real physical consequences for John. The guy shouldn't be walking yet after the end of the original, let alone this, so that ruins the movie from the start. Too bad, but they shouldn't have ended Parabellum so viciously; and enough with dogs on command as killers in these films, too. He had a sweet puppy of hope, not a grown KP partner, in the original. It's insulting to see how much the love of a dog and his redemption has been tarnished here. As for blind men with guns and how they get around in new places with gunfire everywhere, not even Donnie Yen is that good. Glad I got to watch this for free, I sure wouldn't have paid much for it.",5
Liked the 2nd part a lot. After long had to see such an entertaining movie by bollywood. Kartik and Tabbo performance was extremely good.,5

From the time where this movie has been out for quite some time: this movie is an actual work of art. It closes the book on John Wick's story beautifully and is held as the greatest action movie since The Raid,5

I like the first part i think they add more comedy and glamour in the 2nd part which is useless in my opinion the trailer is good but the truth is bollywood never reach the Hollywood or complex plot movies but i love the tamil and kannada movies they learnt how to execute a action movie but the bollywood didnt,5

"I might get hate for this but this trailer was wayyy better than the movie, it was almost too good. gotta be top 3 greatest trailer of all time",5
"The fact that this masterpiece came out only 5 years ago is insane. Feels like ages to me. Especially how Marvel has become to what it is today and the different movies that are coming out now. I never knew that after Endgame, movies would never be the same.",5
"""I like this one""
 
My ONLY issue with endgame is how obvious they were about trying to convince the audience to like captain marvel.

Go back and watch the movie. There's not a single scene she's in where she isn't complimented or celebrated. It's so unnatural and clearly shoehorned. 

People loved characters like cap without ever having the other characters tell us to do so. Same with widow...stark...etc..",5
Amazing movie tabu was superb,5

"The thing I love most about Oppenheimer is how they gather together all of these brilliant scientific minds to find some solution to the intractable problems of the '40s. And the best they can come up with is: let's build an even bigger bomb! This is where we have arrived, Homo 'sapiens'....",5
"This an OK movie. I wanted to see why I into Award movies, before. I think I smarter, stay clear. Story of Oppenheimer, very good to know, though. Conversation between him and Einstein, about their shared karma, worth the price of ticket or streaming service for coupla year. But. 3 hour movie. It LONG. Plus. You have to look up, who win Senate vote. How many people gonna do that? Um. If you a scientist, who didn't know this before, you know it now, no cheat with Communist chick, do you first 20 minute after meeting you.",5

"Where was the whispering and mumbling? The sound mixing was actually quite good on this film versus Nolan's previous. It tells a compelling story and uses the actor's extremely well, as this is a drama after all. You've got an ensemble of some of the greatest modern actors.",5

"SUGGESTION FOR TEAM BRAHMASTRA
 
I would recommend Mohit Raina for the cast of DEV . He will look good as hero in love story with Amrita and he will look killer as villen also, and I think he will slay at dialogs. Bollywood ke heros acche hain magar Dev ke role ke liye I guess koi fit nahi baithega aur Tollywood ke heros ke muh se dialogs Utne acchd nahi lagenge .

BTW I lovedd the movie pleasee part 2 me bhee aise hi VFX , aise hi cast aur itni hi mehnat karnaa 

Thank youuuu",5
"I’m suddenly reminded of a line from the graphic novel ‘Watchmen’ by Alan Moore:

“They claim their labors are to build a heaven, but their heaven is full of horrors.”",5
I get so nostalgic from this already LMAO like this was such a nice film,5
I watched this movie one time since it came out and I loved it so much I was afraid not to have the same feeling I had the first time I watched it. This trailer made me be brave enough to watch it again,5
"Why is everyone saying ""i love the part when..."" ""i love the part..."" ""i love the part...."" i love the SHUT THE FUCK UP god damn i literally only seen those comments shits annoying LOL",5
"That shot before the title at the end, where the hand trembles before activating the bomb, is brilliant. Almost as if they know what they are unleashing if they press that button.",5
Watched it last night. Can definitely see why incels and members of r/conspiracy love it so much. Was a cringe film. Joaquin has fingers that look like little slimy penises.,5
"I am Japanese. My husband's family, who were survivors of the atomic bomb, lives in Hiroshima and I am interested in the atomic bomb, so I am looking forward to seeing this movie in Japan.

Regarding the movie, there seems to be controversy over the fact that it did not depict the damage that occurred in Hiroshima, but I don't think it is necessary to depict it.
This is because the best way to see the actual damage is to come to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum and see the actual damage.

●The atomic bomb was not dropped on a battlefield, but on a city where civilians lived, killing 140,000 people.
●Victims included not only Japanese people but also many foreigners.
●When exposed to the atomic bomb, the blood in the body instantly evaporates and expands, causing the skin to sag.
●Even if their lives were saved, some died of leukemia a few years later, or committed suicide because they could not bear the pain of the after-effects.
●The atomic bomb did not serve as a military deterrent, but instead increased the number of nuclear-weapon states in the world.
●Vast areas of land in the United States have been contaminated due to nuclear tests and the effects of westerly winds.

…etc.
There are many things on display that even I, a Japanese person, didn't know about.
I hope this film will give people around the world an opportunity to think about true peace.",5
"Oppenheimer's historic drama won five awards, including best director for Christopher Nolan, became the most honored film at the 2024 Golden Globe Festival.✨❤️",5
Agreed. Loved this movie. I will never forget seeing this film opening night. Truly loved it and was screaming of joy several months later when it won Best Picture,5
"It's brilliant, you clearly just don't have a good mind or adult attention span. I'm sure there's a comic book movie or there for you, lol. 😂",5
"I wish I'd seen it in the theater, but have watched it about 8 times so far at home. Just utterly brilliant.",5
"Thank you for that perspective. I think we all wondered how you all would feel about this film.
And I agree, Tom Conti as Einstein was so wonderful, I always wanted more.",5
"Some actors have to be heard in their native language, not in the dubbed version. I know this effect from Robert Downey Jr. and Daniel Radcliffe and Cillian Murphy seems to have the same effect on me. Their voice conveys the role they are playing to a great extent. I've now watched the film in English and it works better. .Good that this movie has been made to remind us all of the threat they developed the bomb under and of its destructive power and of the responsibility to not use it, no matter what.",5
"​ @ennuiblue4295  'Her' is also my personal fav. It was love on the first watch, he's phenomenal 🫶🏼",5
I learned this in piano today and I realized something amazing. This melody sounds similar to a lot of video game soundtracks Both directly in general. Thus I’ve concluded the Japanese love their own folk music and put it in everything consciously or unconsciously. We westerners do the same thing with classical music and old folk songs. Classical/Traditional music in general has been sampled by all sorts of musicians around the world. I just think that’s neat.,5
The whole trailer is great! The way the music builds up to that shot of 2:15 is my favorite!,5
"Oppenheimer is a true masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made! A real 10/10, and it deserved every award it won for best director and best picture!",5

"I know alot of people have been raving about this movie and I get it, they made a good attempt. The special affects were brilliant but they didn't focus on the continuity of the movie.  In my opinion the movie was very superficial, it had a predictable plot but was also too confusing at the same time. It was too long, there were scenes that were prolonged for no reason making the movie seem like it was dragging at times. The characters kept explaining what they were doing and why, even though it was obvious which also wasted time. The team seemed to think that the audience are idiots which was annoying and offensive. There was no need for any of the songs which again wasted time. I think the only song they really needed was the last one with the training montage. They focused way too long on the love story angle (which again wasted valuable time they could have used on the actual plot). I get it love conquers all. But they could have included the love aspect without overpowering the film with it. For example in spiderman far from home and no way home. We knew how much Peter loved MJ and that he would do anything for her but it wasn't constantly shoved down ur throat. They are not constantly explaining to each other and everyone else that they are madly in love. You see the little things they do or say while the story is unraveling that makes u realise how much they love each other. This is different it feels like they will stop the progression of the story to show everyone this is love and when they have done this for a few minutes they carry on with the movie. All I am saying is my young neices and nephews who love superhero movies and was really excited for this one fell asleep half way through. That says it all.",5

When I was in art school as a teen they took us to Japanies Cultural Center for presentation of Japanies traditional arts and we were having an oportunity to learn traditional painting techniques. Last day of this course they had a small show presenting traditional dances, instruments, music, food...One song that left so deep impression on me was Sakura played just like this and girl singing it so slowly and like an angel.

Dangal made over US $ 300 millions, and Baahubali  made over US 200 millions, worldwide.Dangal made 2,023.81 crore, the only one over 2000crore, Baahubali 2 1,810.595 crore, RRR 1,387.26 crore and KGF 2 1,200-1250 crore.Gaslighting and  misinformation appear to be common in Bollywood, media feed false information to audiences, trying to re-write cinema history, sad and pathetic trying to undermine  other movies real achievements to create a desire narrative for another movie. I could continue naming US movies that had collected over US $ 100 millions over the release weekend  Top Gun Maverick US $ 124 millions, Black Panther 1 opened in 2018 with US $ 202 millions, Black Panther 2 opened with US $180 millions in tickets sales .Here in US if a movie cannot made over half billion US cannot be a blockbuster, therefore US $130 millions is not remotely could be considered a blockbuster worldwide nowadays all the blockbusters movies globally made over US half billion. Enjoy your national cinema successes but stop creating false narratives and emulating Hollywood, if you want to create blockbusters it begins with the public showing up at the movie theaters and paying for the complete  fare, here we do not have discounts because the movie producers are desperate for people watch the movies, and create holidays  discounts totally  unheard of it, people with their money and presence made blockbusters , respect for audiences is paramount.",5
"This is the MOST DECEIVING trailer and movie of recent times! Read the critics reviews before jumping on the hype like everybody! The movie is NOT about the atomic bomb, but whether Oppenheimer was a communist or not, and all the courtroom trials he had to face. Here the deceiving trailer shows you action, special effects, the preparation for the bomb, electrons and particles swirling around etc. I fell for it, well it's PURE DECEPTION because you will watch very little of these scenes. For ALMOST ALL of the movie duration you'll be watching boring prosecution rooms records, black and white footage - the movie is certainly not all in color as in the trailer... - and endless political debates about Oppenheimer's communist and union affiliations. All of this takes more than 2 hours of the 3 hours of movie duration, while here the courtroom scenes lasts just 5 seconds over the 3 minutes of the trailer (you can count them, they are at the end..), that's why EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE IS DECEPTION! It is the MOST OVERRATED MOVIE of the recent years. The fact that it won so many Academy Awards it's because it flirts with a prevailing Hollywood narrative that champions leftist views while casting the government and the military in a negative light. The movie glorifies a communist sympathizer who was reluctant to see his creation used for destructive purposes, but was forced to by the military and the power authorities. Left is the hero, right and government are the evil incarnate, Hollywood can't resist but acclaim all that, magnanimously doling out awards after awards like peanuts, more for political solidarity than cinematic merit. At this point who really cares about the Awards and who they are given to.. And surely as hell it will be a long time before I watch another Nolan's product!",5
"The movie is inspired by harry potter series .The story line is good .But the screenplay is not .Some how the dialogues does not give you depth of feeling .

"The importance of this subject is underrated, so the movie did it justice, it deserves more than Oscars, it deserves attention because it's a very important historical subject, relevant today with Russia threathening so it exeeds all expectations of a movie, a commentary on the atomic bomb, a history of it, an explanation of it for whom doesn't understand why it was invented in the first place, why it was important and necessary at the time, morality and war don't mix, so there it is and the future of it, it makes us think, thank u Mr. Nolan, what a brilliant work 10/10!",5

Don’t think in black & white sure it’s sad about the nuking but just because they did doesn’t mean they can’t debate about if it’s okay or not plus the fact that Americans are debating about this is better then just all out saying that they love nukes also please don’t group people in one entity for example not all Germans are nazis,5

"Good movie, but where is John von Neumann?? One of the smartest man ever, who was deeply involved in the Manhattan project..",5
My favorite actors all up in this fantastic movie,5
"Oppenheimer certainly is for me the best film of the year and I hopes it wins many awards when awards season comes around again. Cillian Murphy was great, as were the other cast members, especially the actor who played Edward Teller, father of the Hydrogen bomb, and Gary Oldman playing President Truman.  Although just a cameo role, Gary Oldman plays the  President as well as he did with Winston Churchill in The Darkest Hour. My favorite scene was when Oppenheimer met Truman at the White House, saying he, Oppenheimer, had blood on his hands following the A bomb attacks. Truman was, to put it mildly, not pleased at all about this, saying  he was the one with blood on his hands, as he was the one who authorized the attacks, NOT Oppenheimer.  To quote from the film Truman says “Do you think people in Hiroshima and Nagasaki give a s- about who built the bomb? They care who dropped it. I did. Hiroshima is not about YOU.”
This meeting between Truman and Oppenheimer really did happen and Truman was indeed angry about what Oppenheimer had said.",5
"I love this movie as much as the next guy but I personally know people who took this movie waay waaay too seriously.

Arthur fleck is a great character for sure but he's definitely not to be idolised.",5
"i think it's some kind of  bank heist movie, with classic action scenes. Instead, i'm sure there's a physiological 'thriller' that now no longer effectively questions our society but also delves into pretty much every  area. the film almost perfectly depicts the character's natural transformation from arthur to joker, in which the target market is confronted with the reality that this change is caused by society. we do not support arthur but we sympathize with him, he gives you one of the highest quality performances i've ever seen, the movie is entirely based on its ability to draw on the wide range of emotions and research that arthur is going through, even while conveying the experience, feeling. i don't feel the joker is a villain at all.",5
As a Marvel fan . This tops my list of best superhero genre,5
"Now that the movie has come out. Musically I really, really enjoy how the actual track has been modified to make it sound major (happy) to make people come see the film thinking it’s heroic. (Really good marketing). Meanwhile in the actual film the tonality of the music is dark and unforgiving, like the movie actually requires. Well done.",5
"One of the most iconic films ever made my marvel. Great film and it made so many childhood. The end of a legendary era, let’s hope the next will be the same maybe even better.",5
"This movie was great. I hope sequel would be at least not bad, would not try ruin original movie. Either way I will like this movie, and I'm grateful that it was made as good as it is",5
"I am listening to this playlist to study, but yes it does remind me so much of Genshin. They did a great job with their music.",5
"This movie is a example of wasted opportunity. It could have been bigger than anything the bollywood have produced in decades. It had an excellent story to tell they just scrach the surface of it, I know there will be second part but my hopes are not High.
I watched this in theatre there was only one good thing the VFX, i think dialogue cinematography, soundtrack storytelling and all other was done by a 10 year old specially the dialogue it was too bad too handle..
I'm writing here because I'm a movie lover man and I wanted it to be something special but it couldn't.",5
"I saw Oppenheimer 3 times on 70mm IMAX from the best seat. Each time I feel better. I also watched it on digital IMAX laser. The digital IMAX has a bassier sound system. The 70mm IMAX was simply magical. The first time, I felt Nolan gave his best, a good film for sure. The second time, I felt Nolan was left leaning, and wasted time arguing for Oppenheimer in the last 45 min. The third time, I felt Oppenheimer  is the perfect biopic. Changing anything would have ruined it. I love it for what it is now.",5
"Don't believe what  Christopher Nolan says.
""On Oppenheimer film""

 Thus, Universal and Christopher Nolan excluded over 80% of the film’s vfx crew from the credits. Why? Who knows. It certainly wasn’t a running time issue. At three hours in length, an additional 10 seconds of credits wouldn’t have made a bit of difference to the audience. But it would have meant the world to the workers who could have had a screen credit on a blockbuster film. (It’s telling that many of the workers who were left out of the credits worked at one of DNEG’s facilities in India.)

Not crediting the vfx crew is actually fairly common practice in Hollywood, and because vfx artists aren’t unionized, there is no recourse for the worker and no penalty for the studio when credits are omitted or misrepresented.

In a day and age when literally everyone connected to a film production gets a credit, from craft services to on-set teachers of child actors to random “production babies” who didn’t even work on a film, it is utterly incomprehensible that vfx artists, whose work makes possible the final images that appear onscreen, are routinely omitted from screen credits.

Oppenheimer is yet another example of how live-action filmmakers like Nolan denigrate and misrepresent the work of vfx workers to the media, and then add insult to injury by not even acknowledging them in the credits. The fact that over 125 people who contributed to Oppenheimer’s success aren’t listed in the credits is a reminder of how the vfx industry is a corrupt and broken enterprise that undermines and disrespects its workers at every juncture.

This piece was updated on July 25 with additional information from DNEG about the use of vfx in the film.

"Joker is one of the most powerful, well made comic book movies of all time, Todd Philip’s created a masterpiece, Joaquin Phoenix nailed the role of Joker 👏👏👏",5
Great movie. Joaquin really did a good job portraying Epic Lloyd!,5
Looks like a great movie. I love science fiction.  Bahahaha calm down,5
"0ne of the the most powerful  and best acted moments in this movie is when Arthur steals his mom'sfile from the asylum and learns the truth of his abusive childhood. He reads the file while they cut to flashbacks and as he laughs uncontrollably, you feel so much pain and sadness just pouring out of him through the laughter. Truly remarkable performance and even his body language when he is running in a few  different scenes... he looks just like the old animated  joker running.",5

"This movie absolutely and truly changed my old life into a new one thanks to watching it once on my Samsung TV. I have seen it multiple times, and the more I watched it, the more thankful I was wishing my mom to be. Absolutely highly recommended to watch alone or with family members (don't ever watch it with either very young children or babies). 😉",5
I watched the movie it was very nice I love the acting of Cillain Murphy,5
"I am a leftie and for me it was hard movie to watch. But I have to say, so is Nolan and that's why he made the movie. And to be honest, Cillian Murphy has been my most favorite actor since Breakfast on Pluto. So, it was amazing. Mostly thanks to Mr. Murphy. Just looking into the camera until the person behind just can't handle it anymore.",5
I haven't been to the cinema for 3 years and this movie was absolutely worth going back. Will probably rewatch it with some friends who haven't seen it yet aswell. Absolute masterpiece.,5
"I was so eager to go and wach this movie. Expected, at least, it will be fun, or to learn, see something special.
After 30-35 minutes I left the seat. It was literally wasting of time. 10-15 years ago, it would be B movie.
Such a shame. It could be great movie.
After (trying) to watch it, I was so curisous to compare it to ""Barbie"" (movie with bad story). And surprise, surprise, Barbie is a much better movie, as a whole, than ""Oppenheimer"" which should be a spectacle!
So dissapointed.",5

""Marvel Studios' Avengers""
I already had multiple questions forming like ""Oh are they just calling it that? Kinda like a callback to the first film?"" and then clicked play.
I cannot tell you how I felt watching the whole thing only knowing what was being shown to me. Tony giving his last words, Thanos achieving his goal, seeing everyone grieve, wondering what plan they had in store.

the artwork is the best part; but the cherry blossom when it comes out is a gobsmacking moment; the tree in early bloom around Feb is like the most beautiful experience; there is something majestic and sublime about the cherry blossom when she blooms,5
"Every once in a while comes a movie, that truly makes an impact. Joaquin's performance and cinematography in all it's brilliance. Grotesque, haunting, and cringy. It's really hard to watch at times,... but so mesmerizing, you won't blink an eye watching it. Tragic, but with seriously funny moments. Emotional rollercoaster - sometimes, with multiple emotions popping-up at the same time. 
this is far from a typical action-riddled predictable super-hero movie- it's a proper psychological Thriller/Drama, with the single best character development that I have ever seen. Final Verdict: an Outstanding Movie with a haunting performance and best character development I've ever seen.",5

"Disagree with you sorry, I found the last part of the movie too on the nose with all the exposition and scretching music but the character of Oppenheimer was fascinating I thought, the portrayal of the political climate for academics in the US during the 30s was interesting I thought and the way a man who didn't seem suited to running a team managing to deliver the trinity test I thought was at the heart of the movie. 
On the history side the allies were extremely successful at mobilising the best scientific brains they had to help win WWII, radar helped win the battle of Britain, the code breakers helped to gain vital intelligence, the Manhattan Project gave the allies a means to end WWII against a die hard enemy and also to deter any aggression from Stalin, by 1945 the red army was about 14 million strong, if Stalin had wanted to sieze western Europe he could have done if only conventional allied forces were there to defend it.
Oppenheimer after the war promoted arms controls as a way to limit the spread of the weapons, but once it became possible it would only have been a matter of time before the USSR created one.
Life in communist Europe was no joke, it was brutal and scary, even worse in communist far east countries. 
The Truman Doctrine, The Marshsl Plan, The Berlin Airlift were all vital.",5

"Well just watched the movie right away from 12 am as soon as it got released in hotstar, kudos to the entire team of brahmastra because down the line I have faith we will be blown away by the storyline and I don't have to say VFX of course it was way above expected levels. We have a great story unfolding infront of us and there's so much room for character building. I'm only having high hope's from here let's do it. Now coming to the few improvements to work on first the main story needed a little bit better narration with a little more screen time maybe 30 odd mins more, first half both the actors seemed dull,  emotions and expression were below average that's understandable because it's a new and challenging genre for both actors and hopefully it'll be worked up in future, the child artists were on point and lastly the build-up of Dev was the best part of the movie and in the next part I'm waiting for a spectacular magic to happen with narration and Dev's character building, well dunno about others but I can proudly say it's was a great attempt, the entire team deserves more. Good luck 🤞",5
 @MATDMixes  A taught well told narrative with scenes that build on each other and go somewhere.  Not just boring exposition and dialogue.  The process of how the bomb actually works is quite fascinating.  He showed almost none of it.,5

"I've just finished reading the screenplay and have not seen the film yet. The screenplay is very well written. My overall impression that some people including the FBI Belived him to be a traitor and agent working for Russia. they denied his security clearance punishing him, and president Truman was a complete dick. however, at the time he was creating the trinity project, he did not show an guilt or remorse about what he was doing and the cost to innocent human life because of the consequences of his work. he new exactly the damage the bomb would do he even selected the area and site the bomb would land. I would find the guilt of what i did unbearable. also, he took a huge gamble of biblical proportion when they first tested the bomb in the dessert. what right did he and american government have to put the whole world at risk of entire annihilation.",5

Isaiah 13 ►
King James Bible Par ▾  

A Judgment against Babylon 

1The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see. 

2Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles. 

3I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness. 

4The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle. 

5They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land. 

6Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty. 

7Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt: 

8And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames. 

9Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it. 

10For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine. 

11And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible. 

12I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir. 

13Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger. 

14And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land. 

15Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword. 

16Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished. 

17Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it. 

18Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children. 

19And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. 

20It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there. 

21But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there. 

22And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.",5

"I heard this long ago as a child and until this day never knew its title, but would hum it when in context of classical Japanese or needing to meditate and relax and had given up ever knowing its title.

1:35 and 2:10 goosebumps guaranteed 💯 oh my gosh that was awesome. Joaquin phoenix performance was very real you know. I haven't cried for a villan but for the first time after watching the climax of the Joker I cried a lot. It's a hard hitting movie. Loved it man ❤️,5
"One of the few movies which truly represents how people treat each other in nyc. Also I find it hilarious that the period of the Joker movie is the same as for the movie Taxi driver, where Deniro also played a major role.",5
This looks great! I just wish they had done more with Chalamet's look. This is supposed to be years later. Change his hairstyle and have him bulk up a bit. He still looks like a kid.,5
Javier Bardem was a great casting choice for Stilgar. He projects the grizzled Fremen naib perfectly. Also his look of religious awe when Paul rides the sandworm: the face of a man who has seen his messiah.,5
I see many movies but what stands out about joker is that it kept me 100% engaged. I loved the psychological angle and the effort Phoenix puts in for the cast ! Thanx for a phenomenal work,5
I aint going to lie but i love Joker with a passion to the point where i would married him but i cant because im too young so i wound want him to be my dad,5

"For the people saying it doesn’t deserve an oscar are the people who never been thru anything in life at all! Which is fine! But this movie relates to society and everyday challenges! He lost his job, gotten beat up multiple of times, embarrassed on tv which he had dreams into becoming a comedian! The stuff with his mom bro had alot going on had things just would go his way! Murray is a perfect example of who people are in society he picked in him on tv and invited him to make fun of him on national tv! But it went left thats why i will always remain humble i took alot from this movie and it gotten a grammy for a reason obviously the voters can relate",5
"It's good, but when this enter internasional worldwide it's better to not put in singing and dancing just like Avengers",5
Guys I am like love the tradition of japan but do not dream too much at the end Japan not county of angels 😇 so do not give high expectations ; offcourse you will have high standard of service and beauty of nature but do not think that Japanese are angels,5

I hope they aren't just lame and do only up to Children of Dune (which they will do as the TV series of dune and children of Dune were incredible.).  I'd love to see up to that but God Emperor of Dune was the best novel bar none.  Also imagine a CGI Leto II.",5
Has to be the best trailer for a movie I’ve ever seen. Mr. Phoenix needs an Oscar if he didn’t win one already.,5
"Just watched the Indian movie ""Brahmastra: Part One Shiva"" on December 5th!

I think ""Brahmastra: Part One Shiva"" is also a great Indian movie!

This movie, let me see a responsibility for ""belief in the heart""!

If, every artifact (regardless of its appearance) is equivalent to the duty of ""strength, protection and cherishing""...

The above is just a 🇹🇼 fan who likes 🇮🇳movies would like to say to the staff and actors involved in the production and performance of ""Brahmastra: Part One Shiva""!
----------
Looking forward to the smooth production and release of the second film!

By the way, it might be interesting to add a little ingenuity and design to the ""movie credits credits""!🤔

do not know why.....
If the playback speed of the ""End credits"" of the ""Brahmastra: Part One Shiva"" movie is slightly accelerated,
The ""credits list of the movie"" turned into a faint pattern!🤔",5

"According to hindu religion, the Brahmastra, Agniastra, Narayanastra and other Astras are indeed highly destructive.

But there are several more important and powerful things that the Devtaas, holy Tridev and Tridevi possess that can nullify the destruction of these Astras easily.
 
These things are :
1. 8 Ashtasiddhis great powers 

2. Kamdhenu - wish fulfilling cow 

3. Kalpavriksha - wish fulfilling tree 

4. Mahadev's legendary Naagmani 

5. The nectar of immortality Amrit

6. The Chintamani gem that gives lots of worldly knowledge 

7. The Sanjeevani ressurection knowledge 

8. Power of huge boons granted by God or curses of holy sages
9. The holy Vedas 

10. The power to see and control time

11. All Tantric knowledge and powers
 (create magic protective shields and nullify attacks, know magic mantras and their abilities, acquire magic objects through rituals, communicate with spirits and ressurect or liberate them, shapeshift, transfer powers to a being, etc..) 

12. The many forms of OM ( Tridev, AdiParashakti, 10 Mahavidyas, 9 Navdurga, 19 avatars of Mahadev, 10 avatars of Lord Vishnu, 8 forms of Lord Ganesh) that create and sustain the universe. 

All the astras are inferior as compared to these 12 things. 

This proves that having these destructive astras are not such a big deal because the destruction created by them can easily be amended or controlled by the holy sages, Devtaas, Tridev and Adishakti.",5

I haven’t been excited about a movie franchise in decades. So glad Dune I is in a streaming platform!! Best movie I’ve seen since the 1990s!!!! 😨,5

this is just the beginning",5

" @erlanggaalamsyah2481  Gamelan is some of the most beautiful and intriguing music in the world, but much of it feels too stimulating, pulsing, and intricate for it to be really relaxing, in my opinion. I suppose it depends on the particular piece.",5
I dunno if I'd call it relaxing personally. Interesting maybe but more unnerving than relaxing imo.,5
"First thing when I saw brahmastra teaser i felt same like, what you all people talking about adipurush. But i am here to talk about part 2. Amrita is Deepika, but who is dev? Is it ranbeer or ranveer or Hrithik anyone else. I hope if dev character is played by Mahesh Babu.",5
I just watched part one and I must say. Absolutely impressed. I saw the  original at the theater when it premiered. The only thing I miss was the voice in the original movie was much better.,5
Let's give full credit of course to Frank Herbert. What are the greatest writers of all time. This movie is absolutely fantastic and truly brings science fiction back. I love star trek generally but dune is the king! Just as lord the rings is the king of fantasy.,5
I actually love the whole movie.. specially love of the shiva and isha.. at the end shiva and isha scence was soo good.. No one is talking about the bond between shiva and isha.. the love between them .. i just love the concept of the movie and the movie also,5

second time watching trailer. I love how he goes this isn’t hope. Because Paul never really wanted to go on this “holy war” in his name but it was the only way to keep the fremen on his side. Slaughtering millions with his massive army. LOVE IT ! Smiling !!!,5

I have read and reread the first 3 books ever since I was introduced to Frank Herbert when I was 17.   To see them on screen as I had imagined is beyond my wildest dreams!!

He was a very very bad joker, still better than super dom",5
" @jordanhenshaw  I'm glad that you gave the movie a look and that's ok that it didn't hook you. What the movie did do was make a whole lot of Dune fans happy. That's what counts. They made a decent amount of money in the process as well. It isn't really necessary for a studio to out billion the last movie. In the end, it's the book made into a film. Well done.",5

 @koko40800  They all did all those things 10x better than Dune. It's like when someone's cover of someone else's song is so much better than the original that no one even realizes its a cover.,5
"Well also - Part 1 was released in theaters AND on streaming on the same day, so alotttttt of people did not go see it in the theater, myself included which I am super salty I didn't go see it (hoping for an IMAX double feature once the 2nd part is out). Part 2 is getting it's own theatrical release, 30-45 days before it will be on streaming. Curious to see how it will do in the box office, if Part 1 made 400 mil in theaters, I think Part 2 can get close to a billion - aslong as the movie is done correctly. WE SHALL SEE! 5 months seems like forever lol",5
The story itself is good and sad but relating to it made it much more intense and yeah it's a very creative and grounded take on the joker which I like more than a vat of acid,5
"Yeah just watching the movie once without any prior knowledge of the story is rough. If he had kept in all the details explaining everything like the book does the movie would of been 5+ hours long. So unfortunately that type of stuff has to be cut to make room. I was the same way, I had never even heard of Dune before Part 1 came out in 2021 - but once I watched a couple youtube vids explaining the premise of the story i rewatched the movie and it all clicked. I am a huge fan of Dune now, currently reading book 4. Plus I feel like Denis is kind of making these more for Dune fanatics that already know the story.",5
"People that read the bible (the old testament), the creators took a lot from Isaiah, moreover they took messianic features from Islam 2.

The movie contains action, drama, and thrill.

There are movies that you can guess the next step but here you are like a man who is intoxicated in a maze that there is exit and you know you would find it...
their messiah is coming in 8000 years from today, small exaggeration, but it fits to the interstellar messiah, 
really enjoyed the movie.
I would like to say thank you for a great time.

For sure I would see the second movie and the third one.

May god bless humanity with peace ,lush, Health, happiness and to be satisficed with what we have.

Great job 10 from 10.",5

This movie trailer is still one of the best ever made and the movie was awesome.,5

This music is very dear to all Japanese. Someday though as I imagine myself walking down the cherry lined pathway the beauty of the elegant aroma I bet is just as sweet as the ripening cherries.

"SPOILER ALERT continue reading only if you have already watched.



I think Joono is Amrita, Shiva's mother, remember when Shiva was a year old and their apartment got on fire, Amrita was engulfed in flames, i believe that was Dev's doing, but not to kill Amrita or Shiva(anyway Shiva is immune to fire) his purpose is to capture Amrita and put her under his control so she could be his puppet to help him collect the 3 Brahmastra parts and set himself free. Also Joono keeps on saying that she has to do it because it is the only way she could be free, also the markings on her and the color of her eyes are obviously Dev's doing to control her. and notice how they never showed Joono dying, just her falling off the cliff, which we all know not that fatal especially to powerful beings like them, and the most important and biggest giveaway for me is that Joono's power is water, and we all know Amrita's power is water. she is the strongest water user that could go at par against Dev. BUT! if Amrita is indeed already dead, then that is such a bummer considering she one of the strongest beings that could defeat Dev.",5
Very much excited for part 2 : DEV very keen to know that who is going to play the character of dev it's very interesting and suspenseful movie appreciated to the makers 👏👏👏,5
I'm just so happy they put miss flo as princess irulan great choice,5
" @Error-bx8dj  see dude, see Logan such a serious movie and a dark plot, Daredevil has such a rich, fun, also a dark story.

Now you see mcu movies ""MCU"" it's never serious every scene has some kind of humour no matter if it needs it or not, They are turning the most darkest and serious characters into literal clowns now. Take Gorr for example they ruined it, The director said they were going to add a scene of Gorr dancing DANCING.
Only some mcu movies seem serious and has some few but satisfying humour.
Take daredevil for example Foggy's character in all seasons have given such good humour.",5
I see robert di niro and oh how he played taxi driver so much better that inspired joker.,5

Without doubt the most exciting talent of this generation. Bring it on.",5
Wow wow best every I saw in my it conntected to superheros,5
"I honestly was confused for a few moments and thought this was a hoax. I had watched the original Dune movie growing up as a kid that has the same actor that plays Picard in star trek in it. I had also seen the Scifi later renamed Syfy channel movie series on it. My dad at the time of seeing the syfy one was like this is the best they could do without boring everyone to do death, otherwise to tell the whole story of just this part of the overrall Dune universe would actually take weeks to months of video footage. Alot of which woulda been the boring politics not as much action as you might hope for. 

 Reason I think I was confused is I might have seen a little bit of the new dune part one and thought it was the syfy one without thinking, not sure. I will say sadly the old man passed in 2014 so at least he got to see the syfy one. I think he woulda loved this one to.",5
No matter what the hatters and negative mindset people say even without realising what actually the hardwork and efforts had been put to make this kind of world class work.atleast instead of criticizing they should realise the real work. Once again thank you for this ayan sir. You did a great job. Respect increases for you for this. Heartly thank you and being proud as our indian cinema at this level of art big hats off to whole team of brahmastra 🙏❤️ you guys really deserve respect and love.,5

" @jonplaud  Games of Throne proved you wrong on whether it's for wide audience or not, because at one point, it was worth over a billion of dollars. Dune is a perfect blend of PG-13 and engaging in the similar genre as Games of Thrones with some political intrigues and adventures.",5
"Man I remember when the trailer and showed my brother it and he said it was going to be bad. He laughed at me but nobody is laughing now. 3 years later, still probs one of my fav movies.",5
I don't know why but this goes so hard. It's so beautiful and mysterious  almost longing. My baby seems to love this too,5
" @jonplaud the only way to fully appreciate the film is to have read the first book, and yes its true that hard sci-fi is not for everyone. This is one of the richest universes with one of the most complex plot unravels in any form of fiction.",5

" @juwe7143  point of the movie is clear. I'm not talking about ""point of tge movie"" or ""who is Oppenheimer"".
Ok, as you (obviosly) don't get it, let me describe you this way:
1) everyone is talking about fantastic dish. It's made by one of the most recognisible chef. Everyone who tries this dish, says it's fanrastic, it fabolous. It's a sensation. Then you finally have a chance to try it. You got the dish, took a first bite, and you find it - bland. No taste, no salt, no pepper, no any spices or texture. Ok, maybe it will be in another bite. Again, the same taste. Then you wait for a minute, maybe it will be some aftertaste. Nope, nothing. Ok, you grab one more bite, maybe you got the ""wrong side"", but again - nothing. Tasteless. Will you continue to eat? I will certenly not. Then you share your opinion, and some guy tells you: ""Well, you should eat everything, later it will be better!""
or:
2) your friend has a fantastic car. He tells you about this great ride, fantasticly comfortable, great looking, fast and it sounds so good. You come one day to see his car, to take a ride with him, be he cannoz start it even after 20 minutes. But, he swears that it is a great, fantastic car. After 20 minutes, you leave thinking ""what a sh*tbox"". But, he swears that it is a fantastic car. When, and if, he starts it.

Btw. I studied mathematics and physics, so do not worry about my knowledge. And that's exactly why I find this movie bad. Again: if it has nothing to keep me seated at the beginnig - it's a waste of time.",5

Thankful that this latest entry is way more fun and entertaining than part 9 being so downtrodden and halted by flashbacks
There’s lots of parallels of fathers and their sons, the trauma in our lives makes us who we are, how do we choose the ones we save?
The action scenes are the most impressive from a giant ball explosive in Rome to two semi trucks colliding on a dam
Jason Mamoa is so flamboyantly fun being the most viscous, vile villain in this franchise so far
Brie Larson I actually liked in this as she sees the Agency has lost its true purpose
I’m so happy Cipher had much more to do this time and it’s shocking Dante has way more power over her
Tej and Roman still have the most fun banter among themselves
It stinks it ends on such a big cliffhanger given we’ve got two more installments to wrap things up and lots of the dialogue is terrible
But the mid credits scene thankfully will bring back a fan favorite from earlier movies and the resurrection of another beloved character believed to have died
Dominic has always had his family and he will never give up not even letting Dante attempt to break him
Can they stop Dante once and for all without being slain one by one?
Better than part 9 for sure but the last two installments might tell a different story",5

I’ll be supporting the genius of Christopher Nolan in IMAX like everyone else should. Support ppl that truly love cinema!,5
Love this film... Todd Philips did an amazing job with The Joker and Joaquin phoenix performed so good too!,5
"The movies are getting beter but I wish less action more cars and races 

And if they bring back Brian in my opinion I think Cody is great for the role without cgi",5
I'm an Irish man from dublin and where so proud of cillan so wonderful to see him get lead role fantastic actor can't wait to see his movie,5
Artists ever get together not cause their Will if not cause Godself show them who's faces need to know the others part of tribulations or líes SO in one person on movie would be 8 persons who's God get for help SO all is figurative You must to check the book of the meanning of dreams never blood on movie is blood if not gossips and if someone kill someone means he or she get married this People with their real LOVE SO enjoy all movies,5
Bhai atleast they tried something fresh and new... Aaj kal MCU ka bhi haalat acchi nahi chal rhai hai bro... U should appreciate the time and effort the creators and the VFX artist has taken to make this movie instead of making fun of it ...,5
Wow this is beautiful,5
An irradiated epic indeed! This movie belongs alongside the likes of (the day after) and (damnation alley) plus every other great and not so great radioactive flick!,5
yep but this is originally from Meiji Period so Genshin would like to be inspired by them,5
"there are movies which i love, and movies which i love to watch..

i just watched this.. such a complex work of art, very deep, each scene and visuals means something important, a lot of messages here, a lot of hidden stuff you can explore..
insanely hard work has been done for this movie so it's hard to watch..
the whole idea is good, scenes/scripting are perfect, the acting is top class, and that's the reason this movie blows emotionally..

definitely i'll remember this movie for a long time",5
"Not only is Cillian Murphy a great actor, but he looks identical to J. Robert Oppenheimer.  I can't think of anyone more perfect for this role.",5
"I think the Outrage Mob, aka Leftists, aka average person who lives in Los Angeles or New York City today would hate and not approve of calling a bomb Fat Man, or maybe they would because it is a male, and they are anti-Male, but if it were called Fat Lady they would demand a name change for not upholding Body Positivity. 

The other is called Little Man. Again, as they are anti-male they would be ok with this but would demand a name change like Stature Challenged as the term Little is offensive to them. Honestly, today they would or should make a Fat Woman and Little Woman H-bombs 'for Equity' and yes these both must be people of color and other marginalized groups, but knowing how the State department and military operate today they would love that suggestion. 

Yet, they would use updated current year terms like 'Plus Sized Woman' and ""Vertically Declined Woman' for the names. Then a public relations campaign to promote using Lizzo and Ariana Grande for the Spokes Person for this campaign, even though both are woman, and you would think they should use Spokes Woman, but nope, the term Woman is not 'inclusive' and thus even though they are both literally biological woman, they would use the term Spokes Person. 

Eventually the term Person will become offensive in the future when Artificial Intelligence is more of a thing and they will say 'what is a Person' just like they do with Tanswoman today. Yes, that will become a real thing in the future and you are reading prophetic words right now so one day think back 'wow I read that way back years ago and now that is a real thing'. Then they will use a term like Spokes Being. or Spokes Entity.",5
" @-Darko-  ohhhh Lordy. That’s the other overused word. Nah please don’t unless you’re taking the piss at me.

"Can't wait for this! The master and my favorite director Nolan is back, and it's so cool to see his longtime collaborator Cillian murphy in the lead this time! He'll do an amazing job I'm sure.",5
" @AntonQvarfordt  the Guise of sophistication?...really dude? That kind of mindset is what Hollywood needs more of and it's allowed Nolan and Tarantino to accomplish amazing things in the film industry. I find it odd that you have a problem with it. That's exactly what makes Nolan and Tarantino great. They are the best. I completely disagree with you, And quite frankly. So would everyone else.",5
" @PopsiCOLE  Quentin and Nolan accomplished amazing things because they're amazing filmmakers... It wasn't because of practical effects.
That you seem to be saying with a straight face that practical effects is what makes Tarantino & Nolan great lays bare to me what's so vapid about your opinion.
As if whether your using practical effects or CGI is fundamental to what makes a good movie.",5
Wow that's a good time show you how much you love your mom is a great day the same time,5
"There are a lot of forgotten inventions of 1938 to 1945 since they dreamed of cosmic rays focused on  radium powered reactors having conical rooftop Van Dee Graaf generators with stacked cyclotrons while old patents and Riken reports go unnoticed.

Were motorized boxes lowered from ceilings of 1938 to 1945 Manchurian aerospace factories just composite fiber braiders but what about extensive ductwork in background?

O.S.S. Reports show early 1940s Hamgyong Province factories had rooftop hangars for airships and rocket powered gliders since Imperial Japan lacked enough quality ferrous iron too brittle soft of  too much silicate carbon to not be able to construct rail transit tracks nor locomotives amid surpluses of chemicals and silk given Roosevelt's Blockades.  

Hasegawa's memoirs of early 1940s Hamgyong Province described deuterium fuels for Project NA thru NZ and late 1930s patents for extraction of deuterium credit Fritz of Hansgirg of Hamgyong Province to consider how O.S.S files describe how WWII Allied Naval intelligence tortured Fritz Hansgirg. 

Therefore by invite only of March 2019 I gave an MIT engineering conference presentation on how  Noguchi and Songsu of Early 1940s Hamgyong Province worked on a rocket plane engine comprised of a Dewar of cryogenic liquefied deuterium fuel connected to a beryllium alloy reaction chamber nozzle coiled in around electromagnet coils where by cryogenic fuel prevented exceeding Curie Point to lens cosmic rays while alpha particles were deflected for neutrons for neutrons to enrich fuel .  
  
Matter in fact Sakharov's work on muon catalyzed fusion began after Soviet pillaging during fall of 1945 so Alvarez's muon catalyzed fusion began during the 1960s after United Nations Peacekeeper returned from ruins of Hamgyong while Russians tested a lifting body spacecraft with a retractable cone on top. 

Noguchi's Nitchitsu facilities in of Hamgyong province also had Cyclotrons modified for free electron x-ray laser optical traps and xenon argon Rydberg optical pump electrolyzers to refine metals and chemicals before Maiman's first crude ruby laser.",5

I got to say vin diesel he’s way over his head by his lately fast movies I understand his cast helpers they have to act like idiots so vin can look good but now Jason Mamoa his script is written by vin diesel so let’s take a Quick Look at Jason Momoa he’s dressed like a Pimp the mustache and he acts like an Idiot and on top of that vin got him to say Damn he’s fast and do you all know why is because vin diesel wants to look Superior because he knows if Jason momoa acts like himself Jason will take away the spot light of vin and besides vin diesel is old already and when I see his fast movies he acts like if he was an Avengers and somehow all his enemies they become their friends and people who died somehow vin diesel brings them back to life so applauded vin for his dumb ideas thinking he’s the best writer 🤢🤮,5
Joaquin Phoenix is one of the most promising actors to have ever graced the planet. He’s certainly aware of his own power and reputation as an actor who truly believes in the art of acting itself.,5
Wonderful casting. I admit I am biased towards Emily Blunt because she is my foremost fantasy woman. I've recently became aware of how talented Murphy is and I look forward to buying my ticket. I hope for the sake of Cinema many others do also. Thanks Nolan for the story about a real life person. We don't get those very often and I've had enough Marvel Comic BS,5
"I really love this movie but I'd love to know that at 1:35 there's a sound like radio noise I've heard it in many nuclear test documentaries but don't know what it is

"I hope & Pray Christopher Nolan tells the Truth about the  UFO's that came in to Stop the Humans from detonating the Hydrogen Bomb, basically interstellar beings does not want us messing around with that kind of power cause it can destroy the galaxy.. The Other Interstellar beings will never attack us, they just watch, because where like children playing with guns, baby-sitting basically.. Thats why we as a people will never witness or see that bomb go off they will defuse it..... GOD BLESS KEEP YOUR 3RD EYE OPEN NEVER STOP LEARNING....!!!!!!!!!!!!!",5
I feel like the interstellar sound track got some inspiration from this beautiful song,5
"Okay so I know this is a bit late, but I was rewatching this movie and that first scene with Arthur making the kid laugh on the bus always confused me because I never understood why that mother had a go at him, until I realised that because this whole movie is run through Arthur's subjective point of view that he was actually making that kid cry but he just perceived it as laughter.

"This is not only the worst film in the franchise but also the worst film I've ever seen. 

I mean seriously what the fuck happened? I'm well aware that the F&F franchise isn't made for the Academy Awards, but honestly up to COVID these films have always had great entertainment value, so much so that they've been a guilty pleasure of sorts for me. But this abomination? This is the result from having a room of writers circle jerking to come up with the worst dialogues possible to jam into the most unimaginative, poorly executed garbage of story beats, so that they can stitch something together that passes for a poor excuse of a film. 

It's so blatantly, laughably awful that I'm honestly wondering if the Studio intentionally sabotaged their own production or if this whole thing was meant to be a giant meta satire. It's like they knew people would pay to consume whatever they put out without ever holding them responsible for having an ounce of creative integrity. 

It is such a shame to see this franchise sink this low.",5

"You could tell right away from the trailers for Folie a Deux that something was dearly missing. It didn't have that ""it"" factor. That feeling like you were in for a special film. ALL the trailers for Joker 2019 clearly indicated a grand movie though small in scale it's was big on character. The antithesis of Endgame that year. Folie NEVER should have been made. What a mistake!",5
"I just saw Joker Folie A Duex on Oct 4th, And i remember watching Joker 2019 on Oct 4th too. But I have to say after watching Folie A Duex my respect for 2019's original gained like 2000x more. Why did you do such a thing Todd Philips and WB ?",5

"Man, considering how many people flipped out when Pattinson's role was announced, still seeing him as the ""twilight guy"", it warms my heart to scroll through the comments and see none of that.

Granted, the dude has been in so many incredible films in the decade after twilight, anyone that's seen his work would have agreed that he was the perfect choice for a dark gritty batman.

I've personally never seen any twilight films but have seen him in a bunch of other excellent movies, so I was stoked about this from the start",5
"3 years today it has been since The Batman came out. I remember seeing it with my late dad opening night, very snowy outside, cold but as we got into the theater, it was all excitement. As the movie got done with, my entire theater clapped after what they saw! Then I saw it two more times in theaters. My dad passed away this past November and this was the last movie him & I saw ever together back in 2022. I carry that memory with me as the end of the film with Batman being a beacon of hope, that was my last film memory with my dad. 

When The Batman Part II comes out, that will be in his memory.",5
Isn't it ironic that Joker has a much better movie about him than any Batman movie ever made. People can say whatever they want but this movie is a masterpiece all the way through. Send in the clowns...,5

"5 years old!!!

My #1 movie of 2019
the culmination of 22 movies worth of story
directors Joe and Anthony Russo do whatever it takes like the characters say to wrap up this series of movies, a lot of these actors' contracts are over after this chapter, and it sets up more future stories for new players in the Marvel Cinematic Universe
'Endgame' is the part 2 of the aftermath of 'Infinity War'; Thanos succeeded in his task to wipe out half of all life in the universe by collecting all the Infinity Stones thereby having our heroes lose for a change, now they're reeling from their defeat, licking their wounds, and learning to deal with the PTSD of it all
without giving too much away our heroes attempt to reverse the work done by the Mad Titan by working together but all too aware of the consequences involved, they understand they will only have 1 chance to fix everything if it can be done since the Infinity Stones are too powerful for 1 being
if there is 1 outcome they can come out on top then they will have to be ready to do whatever it takes
there's a lot of work to get through the 3 hour run time but trust me when I say it's worth building up to a grand final showdown between our heroes and the terrifying power of Thanos
not to mention so many callbacks to the many of the previous entries that fans will smile at 
the filmmakers actually do a brilliant job keeping a lot of this movies plot turns very secretive because so much stuff I wasn't expecting 

the Russo Brothers are breaking away from tradition and not messing around anymore as they show everyone learning how to deal with failure, tragedy, loss, getting new second chances, putting back together things that are broken, making unexpected breakthroughs, being about how much we have left, not how much we've lost, and letting things happen as they should no matter how much we're told to move on or start over
but the movie is the darkest and most somber of the MCU films put together given everything we've seen thus far
as I said though there's so many cheer worthy moments by the time the climax occurs which will bring smiles and tears at the same time
everything began with 'Iron Man' in 2008 but how does it all end exactly? it'll definitely feel like a proper conclusion with this phase of movies yet I am sad many of these players are done after this entry
still, it'll continue to make more exciting future stories for many other superheroes
this is an emotional but triumphant closing chapter for fans and critics whom have been with each of these films since the very beginning
thank you so much Joe and Anthony Russo and Marvel Studios for an incredible generation of comic book films that have now forever changed the landscape of cinema",5
Loved the movie so much!!!! And the entire concept of Astraverse! We finally have our own genuine and totally authentic fantasy thing! So proud of the entire team 👏 can't wait for the part 2: Dev,5
I swear this is one of my most favorite movies I’ve ever watched  I hope the next Batman movie is like this,5
This movie was such a good stand-alone film. Hope we don't get a bad sequel for money reasons that ruins the entire legacy! I would certainly go bananas if that ever happen😂,5
I love Arhur. I want to  be free.,5
My super hero character BATMAN ❤️❤️❤️,5
"In the past, there were many who doubted Pattinson as Batman. But look at him now. So many people love him. And I can say, he is perfect for  Bruce Wayne and Batman charm.",5
I don’t agree that Joker 2 is bad…but what i definitely do agree is that this is definitely better.,5
Welcome to Marvel super heroes,5
This movie is magical at soul level. My emotions swirled like those visuals. And thank you for making this about love. The light which chooses love. ❤️,5
Best part of this movie is Robert Pattinson does a normal voice as Batman and not a STUPID and UNBEARABLE voice like Christian Bale did for his Batman.,5
"17 SEP 2022, Evening show at DUBAI cinema hall was completely booked, BRAHMASTRA PART 1 - SHIVA is gonna be a cult movie with the most beautiful VFX ever used in Indian movie❤❤ yes the storyline was little tricker to understand and ISHA and SHIVA equation should have been a little more intense, overall SHIVA u nailed it & icing on the cake was VANAR and NANDI Astram 😍🥰😘. JUNOON, ZORO and RAFTAR were ossum but JUNOON was little more magical. GURU ji’s ashram was very beautifully managed by him taking along the young students & he is at par with his acting skills . Those who say it’s not doing well sorry to say its an iconic movie. Kudos to BRAHMASTRA team and love to Ayan for executing this on reel making it feel real. Badly waiting for PART -2 DEV ❤ 

ALL THE BEST BRAHMASTRA TEAM",5
"2/10 
What is the fuss about  good VFX but VFX is not everything and it a poor movie, As a genral entertainment loving movie viewer with good taste as well, VFX is good, vfx future is great but lazy dilog writing, senseless scenes rush with screen play you killed a good movie.

8 stars for VFX but story 2 genuine stars
Star cast great acting not to the point fantasy should be solid to its core atleast believable.

Try to enhance the experience. Try to make movie with 1 great song with timing bahubali nailed that part learn.",5
Did he just pull down 2 helicopter with his family power? Wow I'm truly motivated,5
"I used to think the VFX would not be as good in the big screen, but after having watched it in theatres, I can confirm that this film is no less than a literal Marvel movie. I hope they use the same effort for part 2. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for Indian cinema, watch it while you still can",5
Here after watching Joker 2 so that I can remember that the First part was WAYYYYYYY BETTER!!! A masterpiece I might add,5
Amazing movie !! Loved all the songs of the movie.. Great work by Ayan Mukerji and the team 👍🙂,5

Ayan i cannot thank you enough for coming up with such a concept in indian mythology. i being a huge fan of comics franchise was always wishing that why indian history or mythology is not being used. i am rooting for you to be bigger than what Stanlee created. i want you to bring this to global audience. with love from london,5
"I've heard that the movie clearly does not meet the Academy's new diversity requirements for casting (they're all white/Jewish characters), so I'm very curious if Nolan happened to or explicitly chose to have enough minorities behind-the-scenes to satisfy that method of satisfying the Academy's diversity requirement.   If not... then we'll get to see if the Academy backs down and allows Oppenheimer to be one of the 10 nominees for Best Picture.",5
"15 minutes in and already it's absolute Hollywood trash. Seriously,  the whole 'family' BS is so contrived and pretentious,  and obviously  Toretto is a huge fan of himself,  check out his garage with his name and photos of himself all over the walls, not to mention vin Diesel can't act to save his life.Aquaman running around with a constant 'Blue Steel' look on his face doing a great imitation on Zoolander but couldn't decide whether to use his own voice or use an accentso he did a bit of both,, nonsensical action sequences, ego driven script and.plot and characters..Then to top it all off they include Brei, i before e except after a C, Larson,  just so the woke crowd can feel  'included' 
Jesus H Fastforward Christ!!  Recommendation great movie to play on the tv at home, when you're not home. The whole fast thing has become a joke. End it already.",5
"This movie will win mutiple OSCAR  awards for sure, Best lead actor, Sound Design, Best Visual effects and maybe more....
Christopher Nolan will prove once again why he is one of the best Filmmaker of our time.",5
It's Christopher Nolan and Cillian Murphy I really really hope they won't let us down. I don't want to expect too much and be let down T_T so I will just hope for a good movie,5
What an amazing movie. Thank goodness it doesn't have a sequel. 💀,5

I would be thrilled and thrilled to see a combination of talent like Murphy and Nolan,5

"NGL, Genshin Impact Inazuma OST made me a fan of Japanese Music. Heard Inazuma's theme was inspired from this. Came here to see how the original sounds like. Now, I'm addicted to Japanese Classical Music",5
"Uilleann pipes music and Davy Spillane is a favorite of mine. Irish Tin Whistle is great too. If you like this Japanese Koto music, Chinese GuZheng and  Guqin or Zither is excellent too.",5
Fun fact : Most of the comments are filled with I love the part 😂,5
And they agreed with me and gave us peace serenity tranquility blissfulness and happiness and joy,5
"Fun Fact 
There are 3 Bollywood actors who played a character for a very long time 
SRK as Mohan Bhargav ( I hope that Mohan Bhargav was not just an reference and he was the same Mohan Bhargav frim Swades )
Mukesh Khanna as Shaktimaan ( he will return in the New Shaktimaan movie and I think he'll give his powers to a worthy person )
Hrithik Roshan as Krrish well he played Krrish for more than 16 years ( its confirmed that Krrish 4 will release soon ) and if we'll include Koi Mil Gaya then he worked in a franchise for more than 20 years ( I am not including koi mil gaya coz both Rohit Mehra and Krrishna Mehra are different personalities but if Rohit will return as a flashback charecter in Krrish 4 then yes )",5
After seeing Sound of Freedom three times I figure I'll give this one a shot. Once it's available to download for free on the internet of course. I've already given Universal enough of my money.,5
GREAT JOKER (2019 ) FILM - FINAL TRAILER !!!!,5
"I was thinking the same thing... Well, they really played the best of the soundtrack in the beginning 30 minutes of the film and that was it.",5
"I'd just watched the trailer only but the thing who inspired me and  took me in to it is cillian's facial ones✊

I do think , he is worthy for all the cinematic awards lie on land !!
 
Just a huge respect 👏 what else could give me the vibe of craped future but his expressions 😶

I adored it most cause i've that breathtaking  silence as an introvert😊

            Props to every effoting one and hopefully Cillian 🦾",5
I will not be mad is Cillian takes the Oscar this year. He was truly fucking Fantastic in this man.,5
"Now I don't mean to say that the Marvel movies or the Flash/Mission Impossible/ Indiana Jones aren't any good -despite their criticisms they serve their purpose as entertainment . But every once in a while there comes a film like Oppenheimer and you see exactly what Scorsese meant when he referred to these films like amusement parks . They're fun but largely forgettable

Oppenheimer is the complete opposite - miles and miles ahead of anything that these films could hope to achieve . Every now and then during the movie a part of my mind as an avid movie goer kept saying that this witnessing film history in the making . I was reminded of Scorseses quote that despite a lifetime of watching film we've just seen what cinema could do

In its 3 hour run time there isn't a single frame wasted or.a single character that feels wasted. The acting roster feels like you're seeing the Classic XI coming out to play . The right combination of popularity and acting prowess

I was very happy to see Jason Clarke , Matthew Modine and even Gary Oldman in this .

Robert Downey Jr. Once again proves why he's a living legend and shows us fully the man beyond Iron Man

And as for the man himself - I have no doubts that Cillian Murphy is going to walk away with dozens of nominations and is the first serious contender for this years Best Actor Oscar . A lot of us film nerds have been rooting for him for a long time and were happy to see the man's stellar turn as the iconic Thomas Shelby and now with his portrayal of Oppie he takes that bar of excellence even further. I was reminded of the intensity of classic golden age Hollywood actors time and time again 

Very few directors have made me feel strongly about cinema- Stanley Kubrick , Martin Scorsese , Paul Thomas Anderson and Nolan 

Watching this film is like witnessing a live rendition of a classic musical piece by Mozart ir Beethoven",5
"Just went and saw this, absolutely speechless. Incredible movie and directing. With a stacked cast and an amazing soundtrack. It was amazing, I loved it",5
"Watched It Last Night it was Worthed in every aspect
Truly a Masterpiece !!",5
"25.07.2023

Saw the movie yesterday, it was soo good. Loved how intense it was and it has you on edge at some parts. I loved how they portrait the guilt that Oppenheimer had. This movie can also terrify u cause back then they didn't know what kind of impact all this would make and now we have to live with it. And now I'm gonna watch all the content there is on Oppenheimer on YouTube :)",5
"Wow, did anyone here notice that Imai Hisashi from BUCK-TICK played this melody during ""victims of love"" in 1992 (Climax Together)? 
Sooo good!",5
"beautiful, it makes me sound boomerly, but beautiful",5
I personally liked the so called teaser trailer better because the track that accompanies it is both brilliant and psychotic at the same time.,5
Greatest Drama Great & pure artist academy winner hats off to Joaquin..Unbelievable art..Movie & his acting shown human soul,5
"As a Bollywood fan, I liked this trailer and this movie. Before this movie, I didn't watch any Hollywood movie since many years. But the moment I watched this trailer I want to watch this. This movie has all the elements of the Bollywood movie. The story, the music, star power, and heroic action scenes. Most important is the music that is full of goosebumps. I still remember when I saw this movie in PVR 3D 4DX. It is on OTT rent and price dropped and I want to watch it again.",5
This is an excellent movie! Sets the record straight in a very honest portrayal of the facts.,5
"A ground breaking film in every regard.... however I can only see the next Joker film being a diminished version of this, particularly with Stefani Germanotta copying Joaquin Phoenix (because she was such a fanatic and wants to inhabit him for her own attention) the same thing she did when she was suppose to do a tribute to David Bowie at the brits, but made a complete mockery of it by making it about her 🙄. I can see this film being made around the Harley Quinn character and not the Joker and his other movie with Ridley Scott (Napoleon) being based around Vanessa Kirby's character rather than the actual movie. Such a shame that great directors, actors, editors and script writers have to allow this madness for the sake of the insane-woke agenda and woketards, this has already impeded on the quality and greatly impacts the integrity of the film.

Thank goodness we would still have this one, untainted!",5
 @Tridez99 im a Nolan fan but Nolan does kinda glorify Oppenheimer in a way. I mean the movie would’ve been great if he would’ve not tried too much to excuse him. My honest opinion.,5
"It's impressive – to see such amazing people diligently working on something for several years, and now we have the chance to absorb 3 hours of this perfect content...",5
"Need to say Something
1. Shahrukh has done weird kind of surgery on his face to extend the area between his nose & upper lips..u can compare it from his old movies.
2. He has very thin legs which he covers by wearing custom made cargo pants or cargo jeans.
3. In his recent movies, he didn't act..he just appeared, most of the action scenes were performed by his duplicate...no wonder he got operated shoulder & back.
4. Being owner of Red Chillies Entertainment & VFX..he focused to lean his wide nose & skin to look better on screen...u know actually how old he is!!",5
"2019
Avengers logo comes up with booming music and I'm like ""yes, yes, yes, Endgame, nice, nice, yes yes!!!!""

2024
Avengers logo is revealed on stage and I'm like ""god, they're still making these?!""",5
"One of the best trailers for one of the best comic book films ever. Phoenix is on another level in this. Deserved his oscar. Can't wait for Part II And Gaga's Quinn,",5
Just watched this masterpiece today. Clearly the best work so far from Nolan. Brilliant acting from Cillian and Downey. The cinematography and the direction was on a whole new level.The BGM throughout the movie gives chills and is so perfect. And ofc the Christopher Nolan X factor at the end. Now get the deserving Oscar.,5
"One of the greatest movies I've seen in my life. Hats off to the amazing Cillian Murphy, the genius Christopher Nolan and the rest of incredible the cast. This better win all the Oscars that it can",5
You have received the golden movie trailer award 🏆. This award is given to the best of the best movie trailers and commercial. Congratulations 🎬🎬🎬🎬,5

This is the only trailer hits 100million views 

Wow ..................
People beyond LOVED THE Joker",5
"The resounding drums, triumphant brass, and sweeping strings of epic music inject movie trailers with a profoundly thrilling ambience. This style of bold, operatic composition brings an unmatched sense of grandeur. The full symphonic sound washes over you, instant goosebumps as that exhilarating melody unfurls. No words are needed to feel the mood - whether tensions simmering into war cries or heroes rising against the odds to turn the tide. The music amplifies the high stakes hinted onscreen into palpable excitement. These epic anthems punctuate trailers with exclamation points, ensuring the adventure ahead leaves an indelible impression whether it features clashing armies or character-driven drama. The marriage of epic music's unrelenting crescendo and carefully edited visuals forms a siren song, drawing us right into imagined new worlds brimming with action, emotion and spectacle. Who can resist such powerful musical storytelling, the ultimate appetizer promising grand purpose behind these tales? We have those ingenious sound composers to thank for trailers that spark such strong senses of destiny through their triumphant symphonic suites alone - our hearts quicken and imaginations ignite.",5
..this is so beautiful played! 💓,5
I already told the feds as much I don't like them either but honesty is the best policy,5
Best of the Best still.,5
Arthur Fleck is the type of person I would be great friends with just because of how kind he and how he’s always trying to make people laugh. Maybe not when he’s stabbing people or shooting them in the face,5
I think if they tried Josh Helman as the joker he would fit better being the character. He has the same facial expression and smile as the joker just like Heath Ledger.,5
"​ @lostbrawler68  you missed the point. Thing is: nothing is happening at the beginning. There is nothing to keep you seated (except money that you payed for the ticket). There is nothing to tell you why some scenes are important. At the beginning story goes everywhere and nowhere. ""Fun"" means that it should keep you interested to watch the rest. But here is nothing. Literally - nothing. Again, what happens later, I don't care, as the beginning is complete waste of time. 
Such a fuss about ""a masterpiece of movie"", and ends up as a garbage.
If you like it - good for you.",5
"While being lead to fasting and praying by OUR HEAVENLY FATHER GOD THROUGH OUR LORD CHRST JESUS on the 19thday of the 9month on the year 2022, and asking OUR LORD TO SHOW me WHAT IS SOON TO COME upon the earth.....I dreamt of the sky being very dark or having very dark clouds of seeing a great big tornado  or disasters or tribulation coming towards us the sky was very dark there was no sun light the tornado was huge and very dark clouds surrounded it and we went and hid....we came out after it had passed, then a little time after we heard lightening and thunder and when we came out and  looked out again we saw  blue lightening around all the clouds,, then the dark clouds started to separate and a very white  brightness was coming out of the coulds and there were like men or angels on each side of the clouds out infront of the dark ones while the clouds where separating  ....and immediately I knew it was OUR LORD CHRIST AND I said JESUS IS COMING and I bowed down with My face to the ground and honored and worshipped OUR KING OF KING AND LORD OF LORDS.
and His countenance was like the sun shining in its strength. 17 And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead.",5
Watching this on the Big Screen was one of the best movie experiences I've had in a long time. Oppenheimer is really good 🤌🤌🔥🔥,5
"Winning used to be about winning 🏁
We raced for respect ✊
We fight for what’s right ✅",5
"Thanks, not sure i’m willing to sacrifice 3 hours, I get the impression a lot of people are saying its good because they think they should say that or that it makes them feel intelligent.",5
It’s sad to see people like you who’ve had their brains reprogrammed to only enjoy Marvel blockbuster movies with the attention span of a child.,5
 @jasonsmith8500  interesting because the same demographic of sheeple i know who worship marvel also worship every piece of soulless mediocrity that chrisopher nolan puts out,5
One of the best movies of all time. Perfect for our age. I loved every second of it,5
I Wish all super hero movies were more like this and less like MCU,5
"Such a simple yet haunting melody,g totally loved the arrangement, I felt like wanting to sing along all the improv arpeggios. I made a vocal version here  https://youtu.be/aQPH7M1Dj0c

"Fast X, the latest addition to the legendary Fast and Furious saga, left me utterly speechless. From the heartwarming family reunions to the mind-bending physics-defying stunts, this movie is a true testament to the laws of gravity being optional.

Vin Diesel, thespian extraordinaire, delivers a performance that will surely be remembered for generations to come. His emotional range is so vast that you can practically feel the intensity of his facial expressions through the screen. It's like watching a master class in emoting while driving a car at 200 mph. Who knew family values could be so closely intertwined with drag racing and explosions?

The plot is a rollercoaster of surprises, twists, and turns that will leave you questioning the very fabric of reality. The intricacy of the storyline is matched only by the subtlety of the dialogue, which is so profound that you might miss it if you blink. The film is a symphony of profound insights and thought-provoking conversations-truly an intellectual feast.

Let's not forget the breathtaking cinematography that captures the essence of speed like never before. The camera work is so seamless that it's almost as if the cameraman strapped themselves to the hood of a speeding car just to get that perfect shot. A sacrifice for art, if you will.

In conclusion, Fast X is a cinematic marvel that defies conventional storytelling, effortlessly blending family drama with vehicular acrobatics. Vin Diesel and his co-stars have once again raised the bar for what cinema can achieve. I left the theater with a newfound appreciation for the complexities of life, family, and the laws of physics. Truly, a film that will be remembered for generations as a groundbreaking masterpiece in the world of cinema.",5
I love this movie. Masterpiece!!!,5
"Best Music, best VFX, Best cast, Best cinematography, story is average but... Ayan sir did very good something new in bollywood after so long... Loved it ❤",5
"The last line of the play, which I remember from years ago as it was so impactful - “I feel like I’ve left a loaded gun in a playground” 🤯 And then comes the final line “I am become death, the destroyer of worlds” black out, end of play. Wow, I remember that experience so well, it was an incredible play!  

It will be interesting to see it translated to the big screen",5
I pray for vin diesel god bless you im a fan of your thanks for your support god bless you,5
I pray for you bin diesel's and god bless you thanks for your support i am your fan god bless you,5
"I've just came across this movie for the 5th time( on cable TV) and I'm enjoying it like it's my first time watching.
What a masterpiece!",5
"After watching the movie, I felt as my neurons engaged ina captivating chain reaction, cascading through synapses like electric fireflies, and it felt like my brain was on the verge of a grand expansion, akin to a quantum superposition. My brain seemed to resonate with the subatomic symphony of the universe, as if every thought became entangled with the grand cosmic dance",5
Awesome is an understatement. Still can't come out of the world it created around me. A new dimension in Indian cinema. Mind blowing. Well done team BRAHMASTRA,5
"If The Big Bang Theory show will still be on, it would be the greatest promoter of this movie XD

Would love to see a BBT episode on Oppenheimer movie",5
 @josuecasiIIas  wait don't take this the wrong way!! don't be afraid to approach me if you are cute!! I respect your boundaries. :),5

Masterpiece movie & director also masterpieces hattsof Christopher Nolan  who has direct 11 movie total ultimate sir first time  m see inception & tenent did not understand total both 5 time i m seen this  movie than understand last Interstellar mind-blowing movie & now i m seen movie Oppenheimer,5
"He has been outstanding in so many roles Lilly.

One of the best actors of his generation.

Legend. 😊👍",5
"This is one of the greatest movies of the 21st Century. Nail biting and submersive acting, an ankle deep plunge into the fragile mind. You can watch it as many times as you like, each time is almost like the 1st time. Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix complimenting each other like cheese & pickles.",5
"a movie studio shouldn't have to educate the masses but the masses need god and mathematics in their life 
if u have children live up to the basic concept give your children more than u had 
simple right as a community  we should work together
no bs i help my neighbor because I appreciate my neighbors 
I respect them and they respect me and we have a simpatico relationship but it takes empathy first love your fellow human pz
look at the story in the bible of jobe he was temped by he devil and lost everything but with the power of god he destroyed the devil and prevailed 
I hope to be that strong to lead by example",5
"Okay, yeah, Hollywood at the limit. This trailer alone reveals US mainstream thinking that should make you shudder. A tear-jerker dripping with fantasies of omnipotence, historical misrepresentation without measure, devised and staged by monstrously overbearing world explainers. And because they can wrap it up so colorfully, we now believe everything they say. Even after the greatest genocide of the indigenous people, they claim world domination in thought and feeling. JF Kennedy 1990: ""My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man."" With ""world"" the Americans always mean themselves! ... just: ""Universal Pictures""",5
"Personally i love this movie and phoenix is great actor, after heath ledger he is the best option for this role❤",5
Wow you must be really fun at parties,5
"Cillian is truly incredible, I adore that man. He is a genius and the best at what he does.",5
I saw brahmastra today. Its completely worth it. Specially the story and vfx. It is best experienced in theatres only. I am very excited for part 2:dev. Loved the movie experience.,5
"I get your point but that’s like saying you have to understand British culture in order to understand American culture. Sure they are very similar and one came from the other, but you can appreciate Japanese culture without being familiar with Chinese culture.",5
Wow! What a great trailer. No need for name-dropping. Just Cillian and some great pictures...wow! ❤,5
The best film in the world. I hope it will be developed for the better,5

What a gorgeous song. Beautiful.,5
I'm from India. This movie was a masterpiece. 11 out of 10. DC did amazing with this movie.,5
"What a star cast, Oppenheimer is going to be amazing 👏👏👏 Christopher Nolan always makes masterpiece movies 🫡 Cillian Murphy one of the best actors of his generation, happy to see him get the lead role in Oppenheimer, he’s going to nail the role, excited to see Robert Downey Jr. in the movie too, amazing actor 👏👏👏 Loving the chill vibe between Cillian Murphy and Robert Downey Jr. 😊",5
I loved this movie. Watched it for the first time a week ago. It’s now my favorite movie!,5
"Most movies today are trash but this and probably Pearl recently have been total modern day classics.
Joker feels like a cult classic but then you remember just how successful it was and how much is grossed..Phoenix is a complete genius",5
"I'm trying to see what's all the hype on this movie thinking it will involve time travel to learn mistakes but seems instead to add knowledge for world wars to see how far we came on fire power SMH I had better hopes for this movie until I watched 10 more movie trailers hoping they'd mention time travel somewhere in the trailer, Dr strange is sometimes alright but seems to much of fantasy version ""Oppenheimer"" would of made a better version of that if only it was based on time and not war. I would love discussing these types of ideas with the producers but think the ""Ones"" above the government and president might not approve of them since if it is to attract a ransom amount of the world population we just might break a code that ends up spilling leaks of what's really going on under our noses that's why most of those type of people don't speak for decades and maybe finally speak before their deaths but then have that information erased the moment of their passing smh, I still have hope for our Earth's race because not everyone is lost and one still makes a difference if there heart is of gold and is to want to see all flourish🫶✌️",5
I just watched this movie for the first time and I kept waiting for that one thing to push him to his psychotic break and that didn't happen. His lines about his life not being a tragedy but a comedy really sum up his mental state throughout the movie. The way the world has treated him has been tragic for so long that now its comedic. Also the double meaning because a Shakespeare Comedy is a tragedy,5
For peace and spiritual upliftment Indian classical music hindustani and carnatic are best.,5
" @lopobiaxander5604  I was just implying that the movie since it's named ""Oppenheimer"" would of not have been about bombs but time travel instead but that is what he was known for so I understand but this movie just isn't in my interest for world destruction the actor is cool thou I seen him in some  recommended scenes being involved in some gang Mafia I think it's called ""boardwalk empires"" since I like more the two guys who were both in the army they are very genuine characters. I had to update this since actually I never seen that actor play in anything I liked but he seems good and would of made a great time travel machine movie😅",5
I’m just happy they don’t have to rescue Matt Damon again lol,5
"Dear Christopher Nolan, I want to say I'm wishing you a good luck on releasing your new movie, Oppenheimer! I hope this movie will beat that girls-only movie Barbie! I want you to win because you're our only hope! I'm very proud of you, Christopher Nolan! All the way from The Dark Knight, Inception, Interstellar, Dunkirk, and TENET to Oppenheimer! Also I did saw TENET and it wasn't that bad! Hopefully your Oppenheimer will win the Oscars! Good luck exploding Barbie and also Good luck on Oppenheimer! Besides, this is like Boys vs. Girls all over again!",5
"Our countries may not have always been friends, but I have absolute respect for the art and music of Japan. 

Love from Australia 🇦🇺",5
Thank you for sharing that.  I hope that man is well.,5
"LARRY'S MOVIE REVIEW: Trust me. The ""Oppenheimer"" movie will BOMB - no pun intended. It is 3 hours long!!! Too long for today's movie masses. Generation Z and other Pre-Boomers are impatient movie viewers and have become historically torpid. No curiosity. No way will they sit through such history on a level of 3-hour tedium. They prefer to watch a movie such as pink BARBIE. 

My prediction? Oppenheimer will make lots of money the first week or two - encouraged by the many positive, GLOWING (ha, ha) reviews written by liberal critics. But then, as word gets out, the movie will BOMB in most theaters. 

Me? I want to see OPPENHEIMER as soon as possible. I love history. I can't wait! The movie will likely be a great experience.",5
Premier day was such a special day for anyone who went. We were on the journey from iron man till 2019 endgame. We laughed cried and cheered as it closed the story for our favorite heros and our ride. Infinity saga had its ups and downs but ended special for the fans. Marvel can never recreate that moment and glad I was on it with all the fans in my theater.,5
It’s beautiful. I’m American & first heard it in the 1980s as a kid & loved it since. I searched ‘famous old Japanese song’ & found it,5
"""The Joker"" is an exceptional cinematic experience. Exploring the intricate power dynamics between the Wayne family and Arthur's own upbringing adds a compelling layer to the narrative. Unlike the traditional focus on Batman, this film provides a fresh perspective from the so-called ""villain's"" point of view. Joaquin Phoenix's remarkable ability to seamlessly immerse himself in his characters truly showcases his immense talent and captivating energy.",5
"hello wbpics , forget this one was here but it was great for the times of comics.  thank you for mr phoenix as joker from nickels to ledge.  the timing to bring the stories out was great - hardy with marvel was more funny.  thank you - elle for drawing",5
"I already can predict Oppenheimer will be the Biggest Winner of 2024 96th Academy Awards . Best Picture, Best Director,Best Special or visual effects,Music Score, Best Lead Actor, Editing ,Sound,  Cinematography... my prediction is a total of 8 Oscars",5
Ikr bro I just love making random lyrics to awesome trailer music😂😂,5
Sounds like a piano piece and some classical guitar to my ears. But I know that in Japan they already have well built musical instruments since and are truly sacred. Awesome Masterpiece.,5
"It drives me up a wall that Nolan just wont use CGI.
Yes it's true that lots if not most CGI looks crappy, and really give a weightless and artificial feel...
But it's also true that a lot of it have worked and looked great, and hadn't been possible without CGI.

Sure a lot of CGI is scourge, but it deserves cred for when it looks great - the problem is that usually when you're watching great CGI you don't know it's CGI.

Nolan used CGI to great effect in Interstellar with the black hole did he not? I thought that might have healed him from his Quentinitis.
You want to put something like cells, particles etc having reactions to film you're an idiot if you don't use CGI.",5
Japanese music is so amazing and talented,5
what a lovely piece of music and so muc soothing... east asian nations really have a great music ..love from 🇮🇳🇮🇳,5
0:23 that laugh is perfect,5
 @MagnusElpron maybe because it was about the man who made the bomb and not the bomb?,5
my teacher (not japanese) taught us how to play this song on the recorder in elementary school and im so thankful she did i love this song,5
I watched it on the plane and it was pretty good. Better than fast 8 and 9.,5
"As an Indonesia person like me, this Japan music like Sakura and Indonesia's Gending Sriwijaya (South Sumatera folk music) music were the one i most enjoy of. Man, i love Japan so much. ^_^",5
" @borood1188  you don’t care abt that, u just wanted to get an explosion fetish itched by seeing the bomb wreak havoc firsthand. The movie was just as advertised, a character drama epic with a phenomenal ensemble cast and the surehanded Cillian as the lead. The movie is called Oppenheimer, not Fat Man and Little Boy, that movie sucks anyways, maybe try seeing it with less of a primal mindset and delve into the psyche of Oppenheimer",5
"Because of the slowness of the world system as computer based due to the delaying tactics, system slow phase, system designed to fool their minds like circulating system's idiots unable to reach a  particular goal due to ""paikot-ikot"" in Tagalog words, drama reality stage plays designed to attack and pull down, very slow broadband signals, too many procedures and bottlenecks in important activities, very slow mindset of Satan it's pioneer founder, the technology if it can speak in AI ( Artificial Intelligence ) form will be angry to Satan and cohorts because Satan designed World System technology to be slow like a turtle impedding world development and progress, technology was created to make things easier for the activities of humans and if technology system was meant to be slow then the technology system created by Satan was designed to be put into a garbage bag or garbage can for disposal. And the Joker the counterpart of Batman will laugh at them like Nya ha ha ha haaa!",5
"This guy made the bomb possabile and questioned its impact.
Proposed a means of keeping the world safe from it.
Changed his mind about the viability of such a means to keep the world safe.
Was concerned about the fate of humanity.
Then the president said what about him.
Maybe being a president requires  certain attributes, but intelligence might not be one of them.",5
"Honestly says not John or srk.
But siddarth sir and vfx team give his best.",5
I'm currently learning to play a guitar adaptation of this song! I really love koto and guzheng music.,5
A true masterpiece. Can't wait for us to see it a 3rd time... maybe even 4th!,5
"This exact recording helped me find out I actually really enjoy the sound of the Koto. Fits the feel of Traditional Japan quite well. 
This plus the Golsi & Kantele are really nice sounding instruments in my opinion.",5
Love and respect from Azerbaijan ! Arigato kozaimasta !,5
"I have this song on a 1930s record. It's amazing to listen to, and sounds beautiful.",5
A stunning arrangement of this beautiful piece.  Thank you for uploading.,5
"i just don't have the words to describe how amazing this movie is my favorite for sure
Joaquin Phoenix did one the best performances i've ever seen i think this is unrepeatable !
a solid 10/10 from a 🇲🇦 fan",5
"It's sad that you don't even realize this movie was written by liberals and is supposed to be a mockery/attack on conservative policies and how they are contributing to the downfall of modern society. The whole message was that Arthur needed better help from the system, but the wealthy were keen to discard him. The entire point of the movie clearly escaped you.

Even Jaoquin Phoenix, the man who plays Joker, is staunchly liberal and is a political activist trying to educate right wingers about the folly they support.",5
"I watch it towice every day for a month,i love this movie real and Joaquin is stunning i love him ❤",5
"Wow , great VFX and CGI.",5
Marvel living rent free in your head. There are hundreds of movies every year. Max 3 are ever Marvel movies in a year.,5
"Revelation 18:20-24
New King James Version
20 “Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you holy apostles and prophets, for God has avenged you on her!”

Finality of Babylon’s Fall
21 Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, “Thus with violence the great city Babylon shall be thrown down, and shall not be found anymore. 22 The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters shall not be heard in you anymore. No craftsman of any craft shall be found in you anymore, and the sound of a millstone shall not be heard in you anymore. 23 The light of a lamp shall not shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and bride shall not be heard in you anymore. For your merchants were the great men of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived. 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all who were slain on the earth.”",5
"today's the day one of returning RDJ to MCU as Dr.Doom
and i get recommended with this trailer :)
WOW",5
"japanese, indian, and chinese traditional music is so beautiful. wow.",5
Best film award jawan ❤,5
Shah rukh khan is best and great actor ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤,5
"Do you remember watching Smokey and the Bandit There was a scene where a truck driver who was that of Japanese decent, ramming Sheriff Buford T Justice car door. While this song was being played in the background. Lots of laughs 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂",5
"Unlike marvel movies that pretend they’re smart and that they aren’t stupid this movie has accepted the stupid fun which is more respectable than being in financial and hired writer’s denial about the actual connected realism with normal human thoughts and behavior in writing, and the hired denial is marvel/disney’s problem because they hired acoustic and passionate activist individuals rather than expensive good writers like Tarantino, therefore this is awesome",5
"Judging by the trailer, the film is great one. For those who are interested, I recommend watching the real life story of Oppenheimer on my channel: https://youtu.be/lz1wYmhoqyQ",5
This song is so beautiful and also if there are any baby metal fans like me in the very beginning around this time 0:28 is the same melody one of the members sing to in the song “megitsune”,5
​ @mohith8579 yes somewhere feel cringe but love story matter in this film. Totally awesome movie🙏,5
"This is wonderful, relaxing!",5
The joker movie may not be a biopic movie.  But it has shown the reality of todays society which makes the movie super great,5
"I'm Japanese but anytime a happy sounding ""traditional"" Japanese tune is on, i feel super weird cause they're so not Japanese 🤣 THIS is Japanese music.",5
"Not yet watched it, I will definitely give it a try but already watched a documentary years ago about WWII  that depicts escape of scientist from Nazi including Einstein and hiw he was against the ides, the creation of area 51 and how those people lived, creation of the the nuke and many were affected after the tests since they had no idea of what they were exposing themselves to, where it was used as opposed to where it was originally planned to be used, the tension with the Soviets after seeing the power of the nuke all in one documentary and it was incredible. To me I'll give this film a try but I have a feeling I have already watched the real thing with documentation of real life events and people with their sounds and reactions. Still I will give it a go. This isn't exactly what I watched but come close I just don't remember the name of the documentary but thought  some might like to watch a real piece of documented history if they loved the film 🤷🏽‍♂️https://youtu.be/xwpgmEvlRpM
